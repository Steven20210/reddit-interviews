    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

Yes, it was easy. Last one was a lottery problem with a part to control probability. I tried and was very closed but I couldn't find best solution. After that, I messed up my LP interview on the round. The bar raiser didn't like me. So, I thought I will be fast rejected by this round. \ud83d\ude07\n\n\n\nSecond round problem was OOP to build switchable cache class by user's choice. user can choose time-based or size-based cache limitation. For example, if user select time-based cache, remove all expired items after 5 min from input time. if user select size-based cache, when the size with new item is over limitation, remove any items to maintain the size <= limitation. Yeah, it was not too hard. But, I messed up because I didn't consider many edge cases like,  new\\_item\\_size > limitation. \n\n\n\nSystem design problem was about Amazon ads to update clicking numbers of the modal by users and show the results for advertiser by daily/hourly. At the beginning, I didn't understand what it is... I was not familiar with these services. But, the interviewer was very nice and awesome. He explained very kindly so finally I could completed the system design. But, LP was not good because he wanted to get more great experiences with technically complicated. However, I'm working at a very tiny start-up... there are no microservices... \n\n  \nSo, I got an email after 2 days from the interview. Sure, I'm rejected. I made many mistakes and my LP was not enough for SDE2 position. It is my third SDE2 onsite interview. So, now I'm worried if I try for same position after 1 year, can I get the offer or not. \n\n ",

And those were:\n\n* DSA Round\n* Android Platform Round\n* Machine Coding Round (Android)\n* HM Round\n\nLet's go thorugh each and every round one by one-\n\n**DSA Round**\u00a0\\- In this round I was asked 2 DSA questions. The time duration of this round was 1 hour only and I had to solve both the questions in that time limit only.\n\nThe first question was from Graphs topic and I must say that I am not very strong in Graphs and I was not expecting any Graphs question but it was my first question.\n\nQuestion was similar to :\u00a0[https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/)\n\nLiterally I took a lot of time to firstly understand the problem then came to an unoptimised approach to which interviewer was not that happy.\n\nThen after 30 minutes he presented me another question.\n\nQuestion was:\u00a0[https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)\n\nI solved this problem optimially before the given time limit and the interviewer was happy with my solution.\n\nI totally lost my hope for next round but luckily I got call from recruiter the next day for next round :)\n\n**Android Platform Round**\u00a0\\- This round mainly revolved around basic android topics like ViewModel and its working, Activities, Fragments, Jetpack Compose.\n\nInterviewer mainly dig deeper on topics like Services and its usecases which I comfortably answered.\n\nThere was no question from his side which I was not able to answer correctly.\n\nGot a call from recruiter that I had cleared this round as well.

Firstly I told my approach to the interviewer and discussed a bit on this part.\n\nThen when we were on same ground I started coding and I did it really fast as I had to complete all the features in the given time limit.\n\nI did exceptionally well in this round that interviewer even praised me at last.\n\nThen I got a call that I am eligible for HM Round. It was then scheduled for the next day.\n\n**HM Round**\u00a0\\- In this round the Hiring Manager discussed about my experience at Inmobi-Glance and I told whatever I had done in my 1.5 years of FTE at Inmobi-Glance.\n\nThen he passed me an open ended question to design a map app and I had to tell him my approach in such a way that it is optimal and can be transformed into a market ready app with that approach.\n\nWe discussed a lot and then he asked some really tough behavioural questions to me which I answered confidently.\n\nI felt this round as the most difficult one.\n\n**Unexpected happened**\u00a0: I was celebrating my farewell at my office (Inmobi-Glance) and I was pretty confident to get the offer that dat on May 30. Then HR called me and told me that there is a good and a bad news for me. I was shocked to hear this.\n\nHe told me that the collective feedback is mostly positive and they can consider me for an offer but I had to go through a\u00a0**Bar-Raiser Round**\u00a0due to my average performance in\u00a0**DSA Round**\n\nI literally was weeping from inside and multiple thoughts were running in my mind like: \"May be they have found someone else that's why to reject me taking another round\" etc etc.\n\nBut still I somehow managed myself and I agreed to his request.\n\nThe fact was that I also did not have any laptop to prepare for this round as I had submitted my mac back to my organization (Inmobi-Glance).\n\nI borrowed a laptop from my friend and logged in my leetcode account and started preparing from next day.\n\n**Bar-Raiser Round**\u00a0\\- In this round I was asked 2 questions. And this round I would say was the most easy round.\n\nThe first question was based on \"Min-Heap\" which I solved optimally.\n\nThe second question was based on some strings like some word and pattern problem.

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 New Grad -US Interview ( Stressed out about the final verdict)I recently completed my Amazon SDE-1 New Grad (US) interview process, on July 24 and I have been very stressed out how the final outcome would be. I\u2019d really appreciate your suggestions or feedback on my experience.\n\nRound 1 : (Bar Raiser)\nIn the first round, I performed exceptionally well. I engaged with the interviewer throughout the conversation and provided lengthy, well-structured responses using the STAR format and standard interviewing techniques. The interviewer was genuinely intrigued by some of my projects and went deep into the details during follow-ups. I believe I did well in this round. I even asked a few impressive questions to the interviewer and expressed my enthusiasm for joining Amazon. I also mentioned how comfortable I felt throughout the interview process.\n\nRound 2: (LP+ LLD)\nIn the second round, I was asked to present a project and discuss its technical aspects. I presented my project well and answered the interviewer\u2019s questions thoroughly. I felt confident in my abilities and believed I had done well in this round as well.\nSimilar to the previous rounds, my LPs performed exceptionally well. I even came up with unique stories for different projects, different from the I used in Round 1. The interviewers were impressed by the research-based projects and decisions I made in my past endeavors. One of the interviewers posed technical questions about my projects, and I responded with a well-structured STAR format. Overall, my LP was good.\n\nThen comes the LLD, which seems to be a very small task and not something I\u2019ve seen anywhere before. I started by listing out all the requirements and key features, then came up with solutions. I designed my drafted version, explained what I had done, and then gave a modified and better version of my modules based on the frequently changing requirements. I feel like I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve been asked, except the design isn\u2019t in OOD format because the task wasn\u2019t in that format. Then, the Shadow asked me to identify the bugs and mentioned that there\u2019s an edge case missing in it. I debugged my code but couldn\u2019t find that edge case. I had mixed feelings for this round for my LLD. However, I feel like I\u2019ve been actively communicating and keeping track of the requirements while coding it.\n\nRound 3 (Technical):\nDirectly jumped into the DSA and gave me two modified Leetcode-style questions.\n\nQuestion 1: It\u2019s a variant of the Top k frequent items in a list problem, but with various edge cases and string manipulations involved. I gave my brute force approach and explained why it\u2019s not a good solution. Then, I presented the hash map-based approach with two possible solutions: sorting by values or using a heap. I analyzed the complexities of both approaches. I implemented a fully working code, and the interviewer gave a small follow-up. I fixed my code to that change. Overall, he seemed satisfied.\n\nQuestion 2: With only 25 minutes left, the interviewer asked me to explain the solution while coding. It was a challenging LC graph question. I quickly came up with a solution because it was a combination of graph traversal and backtracking. I explained the question and started coding while talking. My pseudocode was fully executable and easy to understand. He asked me to explain the solution using the test case, and I explained the code. I quickly ran through the test case and gave the solution. I accidentally made the question a bit harder while asking the interviewer about the requirements, and my solution worked for it. Overall, he seemed satisfied with my approach. However, I made a mistake when he asked about the complexity of my code. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure about it. But what I said was right when I checked after the interview. He then asked some follow-up questions about my approach and other technical questions related to it, and I answered them well. I feel confident about my performance in this round.\n\nI\u2019m so stressed out about my final verdict. Based on your experiences, how would you rate this interview? Am I having a chance?\n\nEDIT : I got rejection today. I\u2019m totally devastated after this decision, even after doing my best and performing well. At this point, I don\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re even looking in a New Grad. Anyway, thanks for all your support and reaching out. Good luck with your Job hunt!!",

First interview had a simple easy coding exercise, I kind of overthought the solution and made it complicated. But the interviewer gave a hint and I was able to come to the optimal solution that the interviewer wanted. The second interview did not go as smoothly as I expected, I did the whole questioning and thinking out loud process. The question was a LC medium/hard. Ultimately I gave a solution that was working but not the desired solution. The final interview I would say went the best, I actually enjoyed that interview even though the problem was a bit tough. It did not feel like an interview, it felt more like a team collaboration where we had back and forth conversation about edge cases and different approaches to the solution, brainstorming the optimal solution after mentioning the brute force case. In the end we also had discussion on how the problem and solution can be upscaled and how I would change the code to account for that.

    "raw": "Amazon UK SDE Intern Final Interview Experience/Questions (No LeetCode asked)Background: **Freshman with Sophomore level coursework, in an Asian university. No prior SDE experience, \\~30 LeetCode solved (lol). Shit resume, tbvh.**\n\nApplied to Amazon for shits and giggles, shit got serious when I got the OA, and completed it with **all test cases passed**. Started LeetCode \\*after\\* that. Somehow got the final interview despite being confident that the OAs were a mistake, and Amazon is going to be like oops, sorry.\n\nAnyways, after a few panic attacks and some desperate LeetCode later, I gave my final interview today.\n\nThe beginning felt quite like an unfolding disaster.\n\nI connected to Amazon Chime. Camera on. Interviewer connected. Amazon Chime died as soon as I had a glimpse of my interviewer's face. This happened twice. **Chime sucks balls.** I've got a laptop with excellent specs. Anyways, the interviewer said it's fine if the video isn't on. Sigh of relief. Introduces himself. **His English sucks**. He's Czech, I think, so no problem with the bad English on a personal level, but it was not ideal. English is not my first language either, but I'm fluent. Anyways, I think I answered the behavioral questions well in terms of content and format, but due to this English disparity, especially with my slight but definitely present Asian accent and his heavy Central European accent, I **had to repeat things more than a few times.** (I feel terrible for pissing on his English, but it was a very genuine problem for me.)\n\nAt this stage the interview was not a total disaster, but not looking very good. The coding round was where things got real weird. A **single question and it was not LeetCode**. Will not go into the specifics, but after a rapid round of Q&A with the interviewer, it boiled down to **initializing a datatype, sorting a list based on said datatype, and splicing the list.** I use Python, so, the final code ended up being like 13 lines long?  He asked me the **time complexities of the two functions** I created, some **basic questions about the datatyp**e I used (it was an existing datatype so easy), and then, the big question was... **how would I test the code**. Now, unit tests are a thing that I would use, but I have no idea how to write one. So instead, I just explained what I would do. Things like use a database which has both the raw data and the results we should get upon processing, run the raw data through the code and compare the results, and then for the sorted part, a for loop through the list to check if the value of each element is less than the preceding element. For the splicing, just... check the length of the returned list against the input given. He was like, okay, that's good, I think we're done with this.\n\nThen he asked me if I had any questions, and this is the part I felt went the best. I asked a few questions about what he said he's doing, in some detail, as it's in ML and I know stuff in that field. He almost seemed excited to talk about it. The interview ended on a good note, and I asked if we could connect on LinkedIn, and he said, I'll have to ask if there's a company policy on this, but feel free to find me and send a request (which I did soon after). He also told me to expect an answer within 5 days, as mentioned in the mail and on [amazon.jobs](https://amazon.jobs). \n\n**SO. Can anyone tell me how did this interview actually go? I think it went well, for the conditions I was in, but could this lead to an offer or it's gonna be a no? Opinions and advice, welcome.**\n\n**Also. This coding without LeetCode? Is this a thing?

He was smiling seeing me struggle and then I asked him to give me a hint. Turns out it's impossible to do so and we had like a good discussion about it so.

Probably over 400 hours in react, both in industry projects and my own. 200 of those hours are in NextJS, pages router and app router. And, all 400 hours in typescript. I know my way around these pieces of technology like the back of my hand.\n\n**OA (Passed)**\n\nGave a really simple question to modify a very basic react component. Required you to know the basics HTML elements, specifically the label and input elements, how to forward refs, etc\n\nQuestions 2 and 3 were LC easy/mediums.\n\n**45-min Technical Phone Screen (Rejeected)**\n\n45 minutes of Q&A type interview. DRW probably spent about 15 minutes on real-application experience, like the high level stuff about how react works, typings (unions, discriminated, etc etc ) nothing crazy.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of the interview were very technical. I was asked to talk about how Javascript worked under hood -- things like the event loop, and memory leaks in react. You were expected to know how async works under the hood as well (microtask queue, macrotask queue, call stack, memory heap, etc). I actually knew most oddly technical questions but did not know many of them by name because I had spent most of my time building as opposed to drowning in the documentation.\n\nI should also add 15 of those last 30 minutes were set aside for python. Is python static/dynamically typed, scoping (which is lexical), decorators, etc, which I got most of these things right.\n\nI was rejected 2 days after the interview.\n\n**My Consensus**\n\nI obviously have no hard feelings about not passing, despite my past background. DRW seemed to be filtering through a \"drowned-in-the-docs\" type of nerd, versus a \"build-fast build-hard\" nerd.\n\nFor me personally, I don't believe in the \"drowned-in-the-docs\" mentality, so both DRW and I would not have been a good fit regardless. (this does not mean I don't believe in writing good code. I know what is good code vs bad code, according to documentation)\n\nMost of what they asked about (e.g. technical stuff) I've almost never had to even think about during development -- and for good reason. JavaScript is designed in a way where you don't necessarily have to understand the inner workings, as long as you understand the implementation and how to implement properly according to the docs.\n\nBest of luck to anyone out there getting this call!

I have 8+ years of experience as a full stack and back end developer with Java, JavaScript and Python. Is there anyone on the same boat or is it just me? The last interview I had was with GEICO, where they asked 2 LC hard lol. I managed to solve one but couldn\u2019t completely solve another one. After the interviews they let me know that they won\u2019t move forward with me. They haven\u2019t actually hired anyone for that position as I still see the job posting online. Anyways, any suggestions? I am thinking about changing my career ",

It was a question related to circular array but I proposed my solution of a linear array and it never occurred to my mind of circular array.

At this point it was 45 minutes in the interview. When I was done then the interviewer pointed out that the array was circular and gave me 5 minutes to correct my time complexity but the fear of rejection took over and I wasn't able to answer that. Also, I didn't receive any hints in this question from the interviewer at any point.\n\nRound 2: Was asked a normal medium BFS question. Discussed with the interview about time and space complexity.\n\nThe second question was again a hard one. Asked clarifying questions, discussed the approach and the time and space complexity.

I was so excited, I've grinded leetcode quesitons everyday until the interview, I've been very stressed and anxious and extremely overwhelmed but I wanted to get an internship offer at Microsoft. The day of my interview came. I was fully prepared. Even though I applied for an internship, I had 4 rounds in my email. I joined the kickoff meeting and saw all other candidates. In the end of the kickoff, 2 girls spoke out and said that they applied for internship but got 4 rounds. The university relations team said it must be a mistake and they were supposed to have only 2 rounds and immediately fixed it for them. I spoke out as well after those girls and told them I also have 4 rounds, but university relations team didn't listen to me, dismissed me to my interviews telling me it depends on my team and didn't help me. Since I was interviewing with Microsoft for the first time, I didn't know much about their interviews either and went along with what they said.\n\nI went to my interview by clicking on the link below in the email, and waited for my interviewer to come. They are using Microsoft teams. I was in \"when the meeting starts, someone will let you in\" screen. It's been 6 minutes and no one came. I started feeling weird about it and started playing with the link, rejoining it etc. Then it's been 8 minutes. I really started getting worried and emailed my recruiter about the problem. She thought the problem was from my end and told me to try rejoining or dialing in. I copy pasted their high lighted number but it gave an error for the phone number. I told her it doesn't work then she sent me a new link. I joined that link and waited for another 5 minutes. More than 20 minutes already passed... Interviews are 45 minutes and I lost half of the time. I finally saw my interviewer and he was also annoyed with it as well. We were both very frustrated and annoyed. Anyways.. the interview went well, with 1 behavioral and 1 coding question and I solved the question but I was rushed very badly and I couldn't even ask him any questions after the interview, and didn't get to have break before my next interview too (There are 15 minute break between each round) .\n\nI went to my next interview, and for that I only waited for 5 minutes. That went normal and ended normally as well. I took a break and went to my 3rd interview as mentioned in my email. I waited and waited... but no one came. It became 20 minutes again.. I was really pissed off and found this ridiculous. I emailed my recruiter saying that the link is not working again. Then she replied me with \" O sorry you only have 2 rounds today, 3rd and 4th rounds shouldn't have been in your email. Sorry for the confusion. \" They didn't even tell me that my schedule changed too.\n\nI always thought Microsoft was such a great company and looked forward to it but this was the most stressful, disorganized interview ever.

    "raw": "No internships, failed coding interview, got offer!I wanted to post this because I have seen some of the things posted on here about how screwed you will be without internships, grinding LC, and all of that. I started to believe this too and thought there was little chance of me getting a job (May grad). Of course these are good things to do and have, but I think it gets exaggerated on here.   \n\nI went to a recruiting event at my college and ended up having a really good conversation with a recruiter for the company. I sent my application in, took my OA, and then did the phone screen which led to the technical interview. I studied the questions posted on Glassdoor, but ended up getting a different coding question. I answered all the OOP based questions well and had a really good talk with the interviewer. For the coding question, I didn\u2019t pass a single test case and was going back to fix my code when he stopped me. He told me that he was actually just looking to see my thought process and how I went about solving it and that I was on the right track. Anyone I asked told me that since I got the question wrong I was cut and someone even told me I should be embarrassed I didn\u2019t get it.    \n\nAnyways, I end up getting moved to the final round which is supposedly behavioral. Well, they pull out another coding question haha. I did better on this one, but ultimately didn\u2019t quite get it in time. We actually talked through it after he stopped me and I was correct, just had a couple things out of order. Once again, this interviewer also told me that the main thing was my communication skills and thought process. \n\nA week later I received an offer and this is the company I have wanted to work at since I started college. From reading here and Discord, I had multiple people tell me that there is no shot, so I was really surprised because I had started to believe them lol. They said that they really enjoyed how I went about the problems and communicated clearly. My point in posting this is not to brag or anything close. To the people that feel they have no hope because of internships, LC, or whatever it is - this isn\u2019t true! I don\u2019t see as many people on here talk about the importance of communicating and having good conversation during the interviews. In my head, I was thinking either way I want to have learned something from the devs that interview me and this lead to good vibes during the interview.     \n\nKeep working to get internships and grinding LC, but do not think you are totally screwed and will never get a job otherwise.

I was asked Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree (or binary search tree, can't remember) (Leetcode Hard) and Word Search II (Leetcode hard). Barely any behavioral questions. Just asked to talk a bit more about my projects on my resume. Couldn't solve either question. I didn't even know what it meant to serialize and deserialize something. Was at least able to talk about the dfs nature of the word search II and relate it to word search I, but still couldn't come up with shit.

This is my second time interviewing with the company and I fumbled again. I know it's a numbers game but damn, I thought these interviewers would think to ask easier questions.

I didn't know a thing about it but since I did apply here and wasn't hearing back from anywhere I applied, I decided to go.

I made a mistake to not go through the basic programming concepts. Coming on to the interview, the interviewer asked me to mention the pillars of  OOP and I just froze there because I couldn't remember them. I told him that I use these concepts in my day to day life but I couldn't remember which concept meant which term. Naturally, he wasn't amused. He then asked me some technical terms that I had never heard in my life to which I answered that I didn't know. After a few more questions, he asked me to answer a trick question. I got it wrong and couldn't figure it out. In the end, he basically said that for a guy in his last year , I have poor programming concepts and have a low IQ because I couldn't solve his trick question( this made me really furious).

Congrats on getting here, your mental toil has just begun!\n\nI got all the way to the final round (hiring manager) just to be rejected for god knows why (they won't ever tell you because they ghost after). So now out of anger and sadness, I hope I can help out those of you in the future to prepare for this 5 round process.\n\nInterview 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThere is nothing very deep about this one, you just need to suck up to them and say how much you find the company and culture interesting and appealing. Talk about your experience and how it can relate to the work they do. I was told during this call that I'll be moving forward and I've heard that this is generally the case, so if you don't get told that your chances might be slim.\n\nInterview 2: First technical coding interview\n\nThey used to use a third party for this but now they get their engineers to do it which I guess is better? It's just 1 question (in my case at least) set for 45 mins and was comparable to a leetcode medium. Practice with [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice) do as much as you can to get comfortable with all basic algo concepts and you should be fine. Here is a list of most frequently asked Palantir questions on leetcode too. I didn't get asked any of these questions during this round however, so this list is not all that they could ask. Be on your toes for this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jvw7wxexpsc1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a196ba619605ba35192af28bcb24c946d91f925\n\n \n\nInterview 3 + 4: Learning & Decomposition\n\nyes sir 2 interviews back to back! I was applying for London while in the states so I had to wake up early in the AM for this one. HAHA all that to get fucking rejected FUNNNNNN.\n\nAnyway, decomposition is purely just a system design question. But it won't be something like design an existing application. The question is much more vague and you should go over a couple possible design choices, explore each of them talking about their pros and cons then dive into one design. Question could be like: We want to make taxi driver's lives easier. We have data about 8000 of their routes. What could we do? As long as you know basic system design concepts and practices you should be golden. Here are some resources: Grokking system design is always good, I also found this guy on YouTube who does some really good videos for it too: [https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163)\n\nLearning is something unique. You cannot prepare for this what so ever in all honesty. They literally teach you a library, concept, or something of that sort and you have to use that new knowledge. In my case it was a concept, I was taught what it was and how it worked, given a function that did said concept + some documentation. I was then shown code, asked to explain what it did, then told to improve its efficiency. Overall this is probably the easiest of the three in my opinion. You can ask the interviewer as many questions as you want for clarification (which is a good thing) and then use your own problem solving skills to complete it. Be confident in yourself and you should be fine.\n\nAlso to mention, both of these rounds are 1h each, 15 mins first dedicated to behavioral then the actual interview.\n\nInterview 5 (Final): Hiring Manager (senior engineering manager)\n\nWelcome, to the final round. You should feel good about making it this far. I sure did... of course that all went away just as quick. This is a 1 hour interview. Supposed to be split roughly half behavioral, half technical. The technical can be literally whatever the hiring manager wants. It is said for many to be a repeat of the worst of your previous three interviews so either coding, decomp or learning again. Majority of them tend to be coding. Now for me it was coding. My question was from the leetcode list above which was great and made me feel more confident (ha like it helped) but its not always the case. I've heard its common to get more of a Data structure design question like LRU cache compared to algo design. So be prepared for that. People say for the behavioral they really grill you on both resume and why you want to work there. What your desired future career looks like and other questions of that sort. Its supposed to let you talk about your interests with the manager. My guy just looked and sounded pretty uninterested which made me worry (rightfully so). My behavioral was only 20 mins (on the dot btw) so yeah... I've heard that for others (who actually got the job) their behavioral was longer like 40 mins. For some they don't even have a technical too! But how long your behavioral is does not dictate success either. There is a guy who got to final round twice, both of which were only behavioral, and got rejected twice.... I believe if the manager seems more engaged its a good sign?\n\nI personally thought my hiring manager round was the best interview out of all of them. I had answers to every question, tried to engage in more of a conversational manner, aced the coding. Idk maybe I'm missing something but I shall never know!\n\nWell hopefully this info helped. I pray luck is on your side unlike it was for me. If you get rejected join the squad, we got tissues and alcohol. If you get accepted, Congratulations! I am so proud of you, and please refer me later thanks.",

First of let me start by saying the interviewers are amazing, I got the opportunity to ask them questions. In the first interview was mostly behavioural and resume based, then we came to the technical part and I explained how I am going to approach this solution and I started implementing it. Then I was missing one edge case that my interviewer told me. I finished first interview feeling good, but then it came the second one, again mostly behavioural and a coding question. This time I could not even implement a single solution, I felt like I was running out of time and I was feeling really desperate. We finished the interview with some q&a session and he seemed really pleasent answering the questions I asked, but I felt I did terribly wrong on the coding part. One friend who was interviewed last week didn't finish implementing the code on neither interviews and he feels he did alright. I don't know if he is very optimistic or if I'm just being really pesimistic lol.

    "raw": "a pleb's experience looking for an internshipGather around all, I've been fortunate enough to be able to sign an offer with a random non-tech company this week. But the full path to it is something worth sharing (I think).\n\n**About Me:**\n\nSecond year at UCLA studying a math-related major, 5'8\", 155 bench/245 squat/255 dl (pre-quarantine, rip gains), plat4 NA TFT loool\n\n**Summary of Resume**\n\n3.7 gpa with data structures and computer organization as relevant cs courses, research exp with grad student in stats, 1 full stack app, 2 tech-ish positions I held during high school at a local government agency, and a statistics related club with a small project completed.\n\n**Prefacing**\n\nI actually got a B- my first quarter in the intro to cs course so I was feeling pretty discouraged. Thankfully I got my shit together and improved a lot and regained some confidence in my skills.\n\n**Before actually applying**\n\nThe title is actually kind of not 100% true because I continued to do this while applying but I mostly did this before I applied anywhere. I practiced my dsa skills with LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview. I would usually read through sections of CTCI then do some problems in the book and then do some LeetCode problems related to the topics I just studied. I mainly focused on the core data structures in CTCI and did not pay much attention to the more advanced topics (AVL, Red Black trees etc.) After reviewing all my data structures, I practiced by selecting random LeetCode problems to recognize what data structure are good for different types of problems. I noticed that I sometimes struggle on implementation type problems. To remedy this, I did some problems from previous CodeForces Div 2 contests. I focused on problems A/B mostly because those problems generally focus more on pure implementation. By the end of the summer, I solved **134** LeetCode Problems (65 Easy/63 Medium/6 Hard) and maybe \\~20\u201330 CodeForces problems. The other thing I did was to update and spruce up my resume. What helped me a lot was getting my resume read by my upperclassmen friends/career counselors at school. It also helps to attend a resume workshop hosted to get an idea of how you should write things on your resume.\n\n**Applying**\n\nI started applying on August 27th. I cast a wide net for places I was willing to work at. My only real criteria for applying was that the position was paid. I\u2019d get automated responses requesting for OAs (Online Assessments) or HireVues. OAs were a hit or miss but I felt that OAs let me know where my weak points were. HireVues were annoying but it definitely helped me prepare for answering behavioral questions. Notice I said automated responses, I don\u2019t think I talked to a real recruiter until October. I\u2019m not going to lie, it was kind of degrading to send out a slew of applications only to be ghosted or rejected. However, the only thing I could do was to keep applying and fix any weak spots in my resume. In the end, I sent out a total of **317** applications. I received referrals to 5 companies and all 5 of them ghosted/rejected me.\u00a0Here's a nice [snakey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/FR1s31L.png) summarizing everything.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nThankfully, I had opportunities to interview come mid October. To prepare, I did a couple mock interviews to get used to broadcasting my thoughts while solving problems. I also reviewed my projects, resume, and OOP concepts, to be able to talk about them in depth. Finally, I read the section of CTCI on the behavioral interview and rehearsed some answers. I interviewed at three (non-tech) companies, two of them had a technical portion, and all of them had behavioral portions. I would personally classify them all as LeetCode easy questions.\u00a0\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nI was fortunate enough to have receive two offers, one from a company related to education that I've personally never heard of and one from a large insurance company. I signed with the education related company because the engineers that interviewed me made it sound like it was a better place to work at (and TC is slightly higher har har).\n\n**Some Reflection**\n\nThe shotgunning a ton of applications was a little depressing to me because most of these companies ended up ghosting/rejecting me. I think it goes without saying that rejection stings even after 100, 200, 300 applications. But, the only thing I that kept me going was the hope that one recruiter will think I'm hot shit. For interviewing it was actually both exciting that I had an opportunity and frighteningly nerve wracking considering the abysmal response rate that I have. One thing that seemed to help me was to listen to some incredibly toxic music (Future) so I become incredibly toxic (jk) and confident. Then I take some deep breaths and turn up my charisma and charm to a 100 and kill the interview before my social anxiety cripples me in time for Zoom class where I mute myself and turn off my webcam (not really but you get the idea). Another interesting thing is that I thought not being a cs major would be a disadvantage but apparently some people just really liked to talk about math lol. I felt that the Leetcode that I've done was a little overkill considering the technical questions were \"easy\" but it's whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that sums up everything I have to say, GLGL to everyone still searching u can do it :-)",

After about 10 minutes, I started working on my implementation, talking about what I was doing and commenting each step of the way. There were a couple of bugs in my code, which I managed to fix. Afterward, my interviewer told me that my solution was the most-optimal implementation and then quizzed me on the time and storage complexity of the code.\n\nLike last time, after the coding section was a Q&A with my interviewer. He gave me detailed answers to all the questions I asked as well as some advice as a potential intern.

Algorithm patterns are crucial because once you understand the fundamentals of a pattern, a whole class of related problems suddenly become *a lot* easier to solve.\n\n## How do you study algorithm patterns?\n\nTo learn the fundamentals of an algorithm pattern, start with a simple example problem that demonstrates why the pattern is useful. Use that problem to understand the basic structural components of the pattern. Then, apply what you learned by solving a few follow-up questions on your own.\n\nI\u2019ve broken down the fundamentals and created animated solutions for the follow-up questions for the following algorithm patterns, which are a great place to start because they don\u2019t require additional knowledge of data structures beyond arrays.\n\nMake sure you understand the types of questions that are a good fit for each pattern (covered in the fundamentals page for each pattern).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Two-Pointer

important?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Let's say you get a question which gives you a string, and asks you to return the longest substring within that string without repeating characters.Since this is asking for a substring within a string that meets a certain criteria (no repeating characters), you know this question is a [good candidate](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#when-do-i-use-this) for the sliding window.\n* You know that the sliding window pattern involves using two pointers to represent the current window, along with a data structure to store the contents of the window. You can immediately start thinking about the appropriate data structure (a set or a dictionary are good choices for this problem!) to use.\n* Now you\u2019ve identified the structural components for this problem, you can begin to translate them into code, using a [template](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#template) for the sliding window as a starting point.\n\nThis is why algorithm patterns are important: once you\u2019ve identified that a question is a good candidate for an algorithm pattern, you have a structured foundation from which to solve problem solving from.\n\n# Unit 2: Data Structures\n\nThis set of questions will teach you the **data structures you are most likely to encounter during the coding interview, and recognizing the types of problems that are best suited for each.**\n\nStart by understanding the operations that each data structure supports, as well as the asymptotic runtimes (Big-O) of each operation. Then, work through the sample problems to get a sense of how the data structure simplifies each problem.\n\nI\u2019ve written up a guide and animated solutions to the follow-up questions for the Stack data structure.

    "raw": "Microsoft SWE Intern Interview ResultsHey yall,\n\nI wanted to share my recent experience with the Microsoft interview process. This is an update from my previous post. I applied online, submitted my resume, and, to my surprise, I received an email congratulating me on reaching the final interview round without any technical phone screens.\n\n# \n\n# My Background:\n\nI got a lot of questions asking how I got pushed to the final round, here are my qualifications:\n\n* Previous internship at defense company\n* Athlete in college\n* Technical Military experience\n* Minority\n\nI go to a liberal arts states school that is no where near ranked. I also have a very mediocre GPA at 3.1 but I seclude it from my resume so they wouldn't know. (they also never asked)\n\n# \n\n# My Prep:\n\nI scheduled the interviews around 3 weeks from the initial email. For preparations I never took Data Structures and Algorithms before so a lot of my time was learning DSA. I took a Udemy course by Scott Barret called:\n\n[Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://parsons.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)\n\nI was able to access this course for free due to my previous internship's Udemy Business account. It was incredibly helpful, especially because of the animations explaining each data structure and the coding problems after each lesson.\n\nI also used Leetcode, where my Leetcode Premium subscription allowed me to pinpoint the types of questions Microsoft asks. The Microsoft Explore Card had every question asked to me during my interview except one.\n\n# \n\n# Interview Day:\n\nOn the interview day, they scheduled a 6-hour block of time. In the morning, a recruiter brought everyone into a Microsoft Teams call to introduce everyone and answer questions. This person would be the one delivering the offer letter or the declination email.\n\nIn my first interview, I initially thought the interviewer wouldn't show up because he was 5 minutes late. Eventually, he arrived, and after introductions, he asked me a couple of questions about my resume. Then, he pasted a Leetcode Medium problem about Linked Lists into the Teams chat, which was also on the Microsoft Explore Card. He asked me to walk through a solution. I got most of the problem right, except for a crucial part about the data structure. After that, I asked him a series of questions I had prepared until the next interview.\n\nFor the second interview, it was a similar experience with the interviewer being about 5 minutes late. This interviewer seemed disinterested and preoccupied. We didn't exchange introductions; she simply went over my resume and asked questions about my previous internship. Afterward, she sent a Codility link where she presented three coding questions, all of which were relatively easy. I made a mistake with the first question because I didn't fully understand it. She allowed me to try again with some more common questions about Linked Lists, which I answered flawlessly. Once the coding was done, I attempted to ask her questions, but she said she had to leave after just one question and suggested connecting on LinkedIn if I had more. (She did not connect back lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results:\n\nExactly a week later, I received an email from the recruiter informing me that I did not pass the interview. However, I am not giving up. I plan to take the lessons from this experience, learn from them, and come back stronger. If any of you have questions, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer, but if they're too private, I might not be able to.\n\nLet's turn this moment of setback into one of motivation and resilience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for being an amazing community.",

My interview was initially scheduled on September 16, but to \"unforeseen circumstances\", it ended up being pushed back to today, September 28.\n\n**Interview Process**  \nThe interview started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. I introduces myself (major, interests, etc.) then answered a couple of questions about my resume (robotics team, volunteer work, etc.) then we went directly into the coding assignment.\n\nThe assignment itself was pretty simple, akin to a LeetCode easy-ish medium. Specifically, it focused on string manipulation with a touch of DSA. My interviewer gave me a minute to think over the problem and gather my thoughts. I just voiced random ideas for the individual criteria until I had a rough plan on how I was going to implement it. After I told my interviewer my design, he said it sounded like it would work. I started my implementation while commenting each step of the algorithm, talking aloud the entire time I was working. I managed to implement a solution, which initially had a bug that I managed to fix, and ran some random test cases which worked until the very last test case. My interviewer managed to identify the bug, giving me a hint where I should look, but I couldn't manage to find and fix it before time ran out.\n\nAfter the coding section was a brief Q&A, with me asking him questions (why Uber, previous jobs, college major, advice for interns, etc.) and him answering my questions, though we went slightly over the 1 hour time slot.\n\n**Results**  \nI recieved an email from my recruiter about an hour and a half after my interview, letting me know that I moved onto the second interview.",

Final round interview scheduled day after my first round. This is where shit gets wonky. They informed me it will be behavioral only, assessing leadership etc. I looked online and people basically confirmed it would be behavioral, potentially some git vc questions. My interview came up and my guy was a complete no show. Not even late, just ghosted. Contacted my interviewer and he let me reschedule. Then I hop in the interview with anotha guy the next day, and the first thing homie does is open a word doc and we do some LC. I tried to tell him I already did my coding interview and they told me it would be behav only, but he didn't care. A lil hard to understand him. I had an LC ez followed by an LC med... again.

    "raw": "My Experience as a Data Engineer Intern at Columbia University Irving Medical CenterThis summer as a rising Junior going to Queens College in New York, I interned at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center as a Data Engineer Intern and long story short, it was definitely the best experience of my life. \n\nTo start, I got this internship through another company that offers students and grad students internships & full time jobs through a cover letter process. (They give your Resume & GPA as well but to apply to the selections they have you must send a cover letter). A lot of these companies they have listed are purely Biotech / Health related which wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted at the time but to be honest in this field you take what you can get.\n\nI applied 10 hours before the deadline and got my chance to see all the companies, with CUIMC being one of the first I applied to. They had multiple options for different mentors you could intern with. I wrote a quick cover letter stating how I thought I could contribute & why I wanted my current mentor. \n\nAbout two weeks later they got back to me with details of the internship & to set up an interview. I met with my current mentor and it was genuinely the best interview i\u2019ve ever had. I suffer with very bad imposter syndrome so it was surprising to me when he found my resume amazing. He loved what I had for my skills and projects, with great remarks toward my Transcript as well (mind you I have a 2.4 GPA) and we continued to talk about what I could contribute to with details of multiple projects I could work on. We ended the interview with a talk about potentially staying on afterwards. I was ecstatic when it ended because for once I felt like maybe this was it.\n\nOnly a week later, I found out I was right. I was offered the position making 18.50 for 40 hours a week working from home whenever I wanted to. I happily accepted and started June 3rd. \n\nNow to finally talk about my experience, as it was nothing short of amazing.\n\nFrom the moment I came in I was greeted by the friendliest coworkers and my supervisor (mentor) was simply the chillest guy I\u2019ve ever met. We had a chat about the project i\u2019d be working on (Which I can\u2019t give details about because we are planning to publish a paper!) and I started my onboarding process which is always a hassle. But he told me to just work from home for the rest of the week on my 2nd day lol.  \n\nA week later he hands me my own laptop to work from (Really awesome, 256gb RAM, nvidia GPU, massive memory, was really happy) & I got straight to work. \n\nWhat was really great about my project was that I got to build it from the ground up. I built the backend foundation in python. Gathering data from databases and running it through cleaning processes, visualization and output. Building my own database for our group and eventually having to build a mini front end that they could use to see how everything looked (I just used the Tkinter GUI). \n\nWe also had a great office, with windows larger than I ever seen & a view of new york I appreciated every time I saw it. \n\nThough I did have a lot of stressful moments trying to understand what I was even doing and fitting deadlines, it was really fulfilling when I did get it done. I always got positive feedback and my supervisor always told me I was crushing it. I got great remarks from all my peers and it was a great feeling.\n\nDuring this process I really learned so much. I discovered my real passion in CS which is to focus on the data path and work in the health sector, building tools for people to use. I feel that is where I shine the best. \n\nI end next week and i\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019ve been offered a part time position while I go to school making $25+, with talks of a full time position coming my way when I graduate. He told me the salaries for a full time position are typically greater than 90k which is amazing. I genuinely couldn\u2019t be happier and i\u2019m going to be graduating with so much experience in my belt. \n\nAll in all, it is not FAANG or bust!

Main lesson is that you don't need to keep blasting your resume - try to be creative :)\n\n\\----------\n\nThe traditional way to get a job interview is to submit your resume and pray.\n\nEveryone does this and it\u2019s taken to be the default because it\u2019s easy. You can send the same resume with the click of a button to totally different companies, no effort on your part other than preparing the resume.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to stand out, no uniqueness.\n\nGenerally, the way to get around this is to ask for a referral or to reach out to someone at the company for some sort of informational interview. Both of these methods allow for a more personalized approach to job hunting.\n\nBut is it possible to go even one step further?\n\n**Stand Out**\n\nIn 2016, [Chris Seline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dumbfounder/) was coming off a failed startup and looking for new opportunities.\n\nUnlike most other people, though, Chris wasn\u2019t a fan of the resume blast method.\n\nHis strategy was to target specific companies and try to get noticed creatively rather than use the traditional channels and get lost in the shuffle.\n\nChris decided that he really wanted to work for Reddit.\n\nHis plan was to write a [blog post](https://twicsy-blog.tumblr.com/post/135712326189/hey-reddit-lets-make-some-recommendations) and then email it to the CEO of Reddit.\n\nThe blog post is thorough - it\u2019s 2000 words, technical, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into it.\n\nEven if Chris had emailed his post to the Reddit CEO, there\u2019s a strong chance he would have gotten an interview. 99% of applicants don\u2019t put this much effort into an application and receiving such a personalized email is a positive signal.\n\nBut Chris didn\u2019t just email him.\n\n**Facebook Ads**\n\nHe decided to use Facebook Ads to target the CEO of Reddit (Steve Huffman).\n\nHere\u2019s how he did it:\n\n1. Find the Reddit CEO\u2019s public Facebook profile\n2. Use this to find out where he lived, what he liked, what he was interested in, etc\n3. Use the above to run a super targeted FB Ads Campaign\n\nNote that Chris only wanted *one* person to click on this Ad, that\u2019s why he had to go super targeted.\n\nThe Ad simply said: \"Steve: Reddit needs Recommendations\"\n\n**The Result**\n\nChris ended up spending $10. The ad reached 197 people. 4 People clicked on it. One of them was the CEO of Reddit.\n\nNext thing you know, Reddit HR reached out to schedule an interview. Nicely done.\n\nI contacted Chris to find out if he actually got the job - here\u2019s what he said:\n\n*I did not. It turns out they were just starting a search for \"head of search\" at Reddit, and asked if I would like to interview for that job. That would have been my dream job, and definitely worth a move across the country, even with 3 kids and a wife in tow (I live in DC), so naturally I was very excited and said yes. But after a few talks they thought I didn't have enough experience with big companies, so they asked if I would be interested in an IC role. I was, but I wasn't willing to move across the country for that, and they didn't want to hire remote workers. So that was that.*\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nThe reason this is a fun story is because of the FB Ads.\n\nBut I think what people may gloss over is the amount of time and research Chris put into writing the blog post that he eventually showed to the Reddit CEO.\n\nIf we go back to the beginning of this case study, notice how I mentioned that just blasting a resume to a company signals nothing unique and frankly a lack of effort.\n\nChris\u2019 blog post was well researched, relevant, and made him stand out. The FB Ads targeting was just the cherry on top.\n\nNext time you see a job you really want to get, think about how you can go that one step further.\n\n**Thanks for reading**\n\nYou can view the original article with nice images [here](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-to-land-interview-using-fb-ads). I'll be in the comments if anyone wants to discuss :)\n\nI write case studies about tech careers for new grads. Would love it if you checked out my [newsletter](https://www.careerfair.io/).",

    "raw": "My Bloomberg interview experienceHello everyone,\n\nIn this post, I wanted to share my Bloomberg interview experience, how I prepared and final compensation offer I received. This was back in April and only recently I received the details of my compensation.\n\nYou can read this on my blog as well (which has better editing) - [https://dev.to/dfs\\_with\\_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb](https://dev.to/dfs_with_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb)\n\n# Interview Experience\n\nSo, I applied for a SWE role(not a new grad) and heard back from a Bloomberg recruiter in April. I scheduled my first technical phone screen three weeks from the time I was contacted.\n\nTechnical phone screen 45 minutes - My interviewer asked me questions on my resume for around 15 minutes and then gave me a variation of number of islands.\n\nThe next day I was contacted by my recruiter and I was informed I will be moving to the next round which is a virtual on-site that consists of technical rounds. I was asked to keep 3-4 hours aside for the rounds but I wasn't told how many rounds and what kind except that the first will be a technical round.\n\nMy virtual on-site started at 11am a week later. The first round was indeed a technical round with two interviewers. One of them was shadowing the main interviewer. My interviewer was nice, he introduced himself and gave me a brief overview of how the interview would be structured. Then we spent 15 minutes on my resume to understand what type of work I had done and what I am currently working on, what are my technical interests etc. Then we moved to the first problem. It was a very verbose problem on handling buy requests in the front office of a trading desk and it had multiple requirements. But I saw that all of the requirement aligned with implementing a min stack so I explained that to the interviewer. He was happy and allowed me to code up the solution. He asked me for the time complexity of each function and we discussed a bit on some of the edge cases. Next he gave me another problem on balanced parenthesis which was straightforward enough on the first attempt and I told him a stack approach. He was satisfied and I coded it up. Then he gave me a follow up to solve it without using a stack. I struggled a bit here and he was trying to nudge me in the right direction. I came up with an O(n\\^2) algorithm but he pushed me to give him a O(n) and constant space solution which I finally was able to come up with. The interviewer was quite satisfied and we ended there. It took about 1 hour. He told me I will have one more round in half an hour.\n\nMy next interviewer showed up in 15 minutes and he told me that he can wait for 15 more minutes because he was early. I told him that I am ready. So again we spoke for around 10 minutes about my resume and the he gave me the first question which was a variation of all paths from source to destination. I was able to come up with the solution quite easily and coded it up. Then he asked me the time complexity and I really struggled with it though it wasn't complicated at all. He had to finally tell me. We spent the same amount of time on the time complexity as that on the actual problem. My mind was kind of fried at that time. Since we had time, he gave me another problem involving hashmaps (it is one of the most frequently asked questions in Bloomberg). I was able to solve it because I had done the problem before and we finished before time. He informed me that I have an HR round in 45 minutes.\n\nHR round - lasted for 30 minutes and again I was asked about my previous work experience, how many people I would interact with, did I work with stakeholders, why am I doing a master's now and why in the US etc. The HR told me that I am done with the virtual on-site and my recruiter will let me know on the next steps\n\nIt was a while, I don't remember the exact time but I was contacted by my recruiter and they let me know that I had one more round this time with an engineering manager. I scheduled it for a week from the date I was informed.\n\nEM round - This was taken a very senior manager at Bloomberg(>25 YOE at Bloomberg). He wanted to know about my experience with different programming languages. He asked me to differentiate between C++,Python and Java, asked couple of standard behavioral questions and gave me advice on how to succeed as an engineer at Bloomberg.\n\nI was contacted by a different HR a week later and was told they are giving me a verbal offer but because I can't join them till 2023 beginning they can give me the comp details sometime in Aug because thats when they are going to finalize the details for 2023. It took them a bit more time than expected but they gave me the comp details few days back.\n\n# Compensation\n\nTotal TC - 182k (excluding benefits such as health insurance)\n\nEDIT - negotiated up for a total TC of 195k\n\n# How I prepared\n\nI had solved problems from CTCI on leetcode, solved majority of blind 75 problems and I had collected questions asked in previous Bloomberg interviews from leetcode discuss section and geeksforgeeks to prepare.

The interview was for a new grad SDE position.\n\nI was in an all-day long final round where I had multiple interviews with different individual devs and recruiters (5 in total). There wasn't any coding during this particular individual interview, but she was asking technical questions. She was clearly super sleepy and having trouble keeping her eyes open - often she only had one eye open and was obviously struggling to stay awake. I am not exaggerating.\n\nThen, at one point she literally had an actual microsleep - as in, her eyes closed and head went limp and fell down. After her head dropped she got startled back awake, and clearly had no idea what question I was in the middle of answering. She didn't even seem embarrassed about it, as though she was so tired she didn't even have the energy her to apologize, and/or she just didn't give a shit. Just business as usual. Between her accent and the fact that she was mumbling and literally half awake, I had a very hard time communicating with her.\n\nWhen I was answering, after it became clear she wasn't really present or paying attention, it was very awkward for me so I just began throwing out some buzzwords that sounded nice. \"blah blah blah microservices, continued growth mindset, recursion trees, linked list, O(n)\" and she just kinda nodded along absently.

    "raw": "My worst interview ever as an intervieweeHopefully I can share this so you guys can laugh at my pain. I had an interview on Friday with a company at 1 pm and I was on the zoom call by 12:50. My interviewers showed up 10 mins late to a 45 minute interview so my time was already cut very short. One of the interviewer then struggled to turn her mic on for another 5 minutes and when she did it started echoing. After that, the interview started. This is for an internship position for an application development role. They asked me about multithreading and arrays vs linked lists. I told them I didn\u2019t really know what multithreading was but I knew threads, and they continued to ask me large scale questions and grill me on it. After that we went into the coding round. They made me SCREENSHOT the problem and code on my own IDE while screen-sharing which I thought was so stupid, there are free code  share websites. The problem was a medium leetcode problem, and I knew the solution but I wrote my code in like 5 mins because I was heavily rushed to start coding by my interviewers and then when I was done and double checking it, they were like ok we\u2019re gonna take a screenshot and move onto behavioral. I didn\u2019t even get to run my code or test my code. They asked me two behavioral questions and then asked me about my cybersecurity minor and started grilling me on encryption algorithms when I told them I had not taken a course in encryption algorithms yet. But they continued to ask so I just tried to problem solve it. Then the interviewer looked at my resume and said so it looks like you have ML experience should I ask you about ML or operating systems? I just told him my only experience in ML is from a summer project for an internship and that I don\u2019t know much after that. So he starts grilling me about operating systems, and I answer his questions correctly but the other interviewer keeps talking over me every time I say something slightly wrong she starts like talking over me and saying no. And then he\u2019s like ok we\u2019re out of time you have to ask us questions and I literally just asked them what their favorite part about the company was and they couldn\u2019t even say anything about it. They said their teams, but nothing positive about the company. This interview was absolute garbage and I don\u2019t think I did bad except for the topics which I told them I had no experience in that they continued to grill me on. My interviewers were rude and the set up / format for coding was horrendous. What do you guys think? I could be overreacting but I was literally being asked java questions, a medium level coding question, security, operating systems and behavioral in a 35 min interview for an internship position.",

There are projects, there are moderators in our Discord helping people get situated, etc. but my gosh, this is a total train wreck.\n\nYes, it's free.  \nYes, it is *something* to put on your resume. However, this environment is absolute chaos, the program itself is disorganized, the co-founders have some red flag behavior, and communication down right sucks.  \n  \nLet's start off with the fact that 41,000 people applied and they accepted almost 16,000 people. Imagine *half* of those people in a single Discord, bombarding all the chats with questions because most of us have no idea what's going on. We receive information (like schedules, Zoom links) at the last minute, and when we do receive that information, it's incredibly broad and you come to accept that you're going to be confused for the next 7 weeks. \n\nNow, onto today--the day we were supposed to attend a kick-off meeting. Typically the co-founders will drop the link to the Zoom call in the #announcements channel. I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the link to drop. Nothing. I was at least an hour early, at my desk, plugged in and ready to click.  \nNot today, apparently. The link was sent by email (unless there is another place that I'd say 80% of us aren't aware of). I received the link MINUTES after the meeting was supposed to start, and when I tried to join, the Zoom call maxed out in attendance. \n\nWhy would you press the importance of attending the kick off meeting, accept 16,000 people, and only make it possible for 1,000 people to attend?\n\nBut wait, it gets better. Co-founder Yasin posts this in the announcements channel afterwards. \"we capped zoom to 1000. this was by choice for a few reasons: people who show up early will usually benefit earlier. Usually the people who apply early to jobs have a bigger advantage esp for f500 companies. This will be the easiest route for most to get a job.\"  \n???  \nAh, yes. Let's gaslight all the people who couldn't get into the Zoom call because Headstarter couldn't send a link on time. You want to see who shows up early? Send the link early. Let people show up 15 minutes early and stop accepting guests right when it starts. Honestly, it's big big red flag behavior. There's clearly a lack of organization or preparation on the founders' end, and instead they blamed it on fellows and made it sound like they did it on purpose.\n\nLet's also talk about the dashboard - I've been on the dashboard to see what I'm supposed to work on for the week and the due dates KEEP CHANGING. Right before my eyes! The day we're supposed to start working on our projects. The due dates change, the order changes, and some things are being completely removed from it. \n\nAnd then the co-founders are so quick to post about all the cool things they did on LinkedIn. I get it, I too post things I'm proud of on LinkedIn, but it feels inauthentic while 15,000 of us couldn't even join the kick off meeting.   \n  \nIt feels a lot like appearances.  \nBut also, *I'm* here for appearances, I just didn't think this fellowship would be as messy as it is. I was really excited and ready to go. I also wasn't expecting to see unaccountable CEO tech behavior right out the gate. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still participating. Game recognizes game.

    "raw": "How I went from low-level startup to FAANG in 3 months. AKA, Interview Tips & Tricks# General Notes\n\nI have decided to make this Mega Post as a \"pay-it-forward\" to the community. There has been a lot of great (and dear lord some not-so-great) content I've found over the past 3 months that have made me landing the job possible. The whole time, I was hoping I could just have a one-stop-shop for interviewing with FAANG, though, and I just couldn't find the \"perfect\" one I was after. My goal is to create that in this post. Mostly, because if I want to do this all over again in the way distant future, I can just reference this and be good to go.\n\nI also want to mention that this is coming from the perspective of someone who has 6 years in the industry as a Mobile (Android) Engineer. Therefore, while I do firmly believe a majority of this information is good for ALL Software Engineers, this will probably be most useful for Mobile Devs (Especially the System Design section). Sorry, not sorry - Mobile is definitely lacking in terms of System Design help out there.\n\n# General Tips & Tricks (TL;DR, in a way)\n\n* **You will get out what you put into the process.** This is going to be a very difficult process for many. These jobs are HARD to get. Even for the most talented of engineers, there is a game to be played that isn't well-known, or learned, during the day-to-days of the job. The only way to make it through is to put in the work.\n* **If you only want FAANG for the money, I'd strongly encourage you to just... not.** Like I mentioned above, it's a lot of work. A lot of stress. A lot of time and effort, and in some cases money goes into these interviews. These companies have been known to burn people out quickly. FAANG is not for everyone, though most discourse you find makes you feel like a failure if you aren't going after FAANG, or able to get into one. You *can* get into a FAANG company while hating the job, but no job is worth doing if you hate it that much. In this economy, I get it. We've got bills to pay, right? But you can still pay your bills as a non-FAANG software engineer and coast your whole life, without having to kill yourself trying to get in at FAANG and keep your job there (especially at a time of mass layoffs). There's no shame in that.\n* **Coding is not everything. It's not even worth half of your score.** I think the biggest mistake I see people make is putting all of their eggs in the basket of LeetCode - finding the most optimal solution. It's important, sure, but it's not even close to the most important part. More on this later.\n* **Interviewing someone costs a TON of money.** They want to remove people from the process as quickly as they possibly can. Make sure to take pre-screenings seriously. Majority of cuts happen at this point.\n\n# Step 0: Resume\n\n* **You are the best person to write your resume.** Do not pay someone else to write it for you or help fix it. Sure, ask a friend to proofread it, compare it to others, but don't just copy and paste.\n* **Don't just use buzzwords.** Sure, algorithms are looking at resumes, but they are looking for \"Java\", \"Integrated Testing\", etc. They are NOT searching for \"spearheaded\", \"plethora\", etc.\n* **However, wording does still matter.** Saying something like, \"Drove cross-functional outcomes with UX designers, backend engineers, and iOS engineers to create a consistent and scalable user experience across various applications,\" is typically more impactful than, \"Worked on Project Name with a full-stack team.\"\n* **No special formatting.** Like I mentioned, there is a lot of non-humans looking at your resume. Make it easy for the bots to understand it. As a general rule of thumb, I would avoid multiple columns, having lots of whitespace characters, and special page breaks.\n* **Include the following sections: Language, Skills, Experience, Leadership & Certifications/Awards, Education. Optionally, About Me.**\n   * Languages and Skills should be HIGHLY scannable, with *no extra* buzzwords. Do NOT put proficiency levels. Let certifications provide proficiency levels, do not rate yourself.\n   * If you are early in your career, you can probably remove the \"Leadership & Certifications/Awards\" section, you probably won't have enough for it to be in its own section.\n   * After your first engineering job, do not include your GPA, or too many details about your education. They aren't going to care about your Capstone projects after you have had real world experience, keep it just to a sentence or two, or maybe consider cutting it completely - especially if you are moving past 1 page.\n   * About Me is weirdly controversial. Some will argue it's reason for them to not hire you - or additional ways for bias to be added into the mix. Others argue it's great for differentiating yourself from others. I have personally landed on the side of, if I need it for formatting reasons - to make it a full page, or make the second page worth while, I'll add it, otherwise, I'll omit it. Definitely be careful about what you put here, saying you enjoy watching Hockey is all fun and games, but saying \"I'll never miss a single Maple Leafs game\" is a bit dicey - may seem like your inflexible.\n* **Put a lot of thought into results.** Companies want to know the *impact* you've made, not what you've been assigned to do. Even if you don't have quantifiable things (i.e.: Increased revenue by 15%), it's still worth trying to think through what changed as a result of you doing X (i.e.: Generated a personalized user experience powered by X, and Y by doing ABC\"). Here, the impact you made was allowing users to have a personalized experience by working on feature ABC with data X and Y. Think creatively here - DO NOT MAKE UP STUFF, but expand your horizons of what a result is. Revenue increase, app store rating increase, quicker code reviews, improved team/client satisfaction, reduced bug reports, etc.\n* **Make sure your resume is targeting the job you WANT not the job you HAVE.** Another mistake I see people make is writing your resume with a focus on mid-level items because that is your current level, when you are trying to get Senior at the next company. You may not be a \"leader\" right now, but think about any leadership skills you've done as a mid-level that can be used to put you in a senior-level light. Again, do not make things up, but even if you've mentored a single person, or led a single feature, write that down.\n* **Make slight changes to your resume for each job you are applying to.** If you are a full-stack developer, but the job is looking for strictly backend. Highlight the backend work - maybe add more detail there, even. If you are an Android dev, and it is clear the company is looking for Jetpack Compose devs, make sure that is listed near the top - potentially even remove XML if you don't think it's necessary. Look at the job listing, and make sure you've hit on the majority of it in your resume. Resumes take time, hours even. If you find you've \"applied to hundreds, but haven't heard back from one\" ask if you've put in the time for that specific job. If the answer is no, do better.\"\n* **Avoid pronouns when describing your experiences.** Don't put \"I worked on project...\" just say \"Worked on...\"\n\n# Step 1: Interacting with Recruiters\n\n* **Have some goddamn empathy.** Look, finding a job is an incredibly stressful time in your life. For most of us, we are looking for a new job because we dislike our current ones for one reason or another, or maybe it's for a big move. Just stress on stress on stress. And I get it, right? They're recruiters - this is their *job* - they should be willing to get on the phone with you at all hours of the day because this is what they are getting paid to do! Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say you gotta bullshit them. I'm not sending giftcards, or thank you notes - I'm not singing their praises back to them. But have some understanding for another human being who has 100s of you trying to get in touch with them on the regular - while they are also figuring out how people should best fill out paperwork, apply for citizenship, look for new candidates, etc. ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS when it feels like there are 1000s of applicants for a single job. You don't have to be a suck-up, but dear god understand when they don't respond to you within a few minutes.\n* **Ask questions as early as possible.** Not only could this look good as it shows you are putting in the work, and not leaving it to the last second, but it also gives them time to respond to you.\n* **Figure out the best way to get in touch with them.** One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is that they assume you can only communicate by e-mail, or maybe some tool. Not everyone is built the same. Straight up ask them, \"What is the best way I can get in touch with you?\" I've had some recruiters prefer texting, some comments on a Google Doc, some email, and some others in between. Help THEM help YOU. Make it as easy for them to respond, and they will probably do so.\n* **Prepare for the meetings you will have with them during the interview process.** It seems kind of silly that you have to prepare even just to meet with recruiters, when you are already killing yourself to prepare for the actual interview, but it's quite critical, in my opinion. I'm not saying you have to spend hours preparing for this interview, but do you know the best time you are guaranteed an answer to your questions? That's right, face-to-face. If you are meeting right before the phone-screen, make sure you have looked into what the phone-screen is for that company and come with any questions you have about it. Moving to the on-site? Here's only a billion questions I have about that. Team Matching - boom, here's some concerns I have there too. Write questions down if you need to. These things can be nerve-wracking, or happen very quickly, make sure you are organized to get through them all.\n* **Remember, they are here to help you, not hurt you.** It may be quite obvious, but typically they get paid if you get the job. Don't be afraid to ask questions - even if you are think they are silly. They *want* you getting the job. They will answer as much as they are legally allowed to. Don't be afraid to use them as a resource, but also, make sure you don't inundate them either. It's best to ask 10 questions at once, rather than 1 question every other day. Context switching is not fun for them either.\n\n# Step 2: Coding Rounds\n\n**General Tips & Tricks**\n\n* **I said it before, I'll say it again, you will get out of this what you put into the process.** You will not learn anything doing it once a week. You will not retain that information if you look at a topic once a month. You must continuously run drill over and over and over again.\n* **Don't compare yourself to other LeetCoders.** People cheat, people have no lives, people are weird. It doesn't matter how others are doing, what their ranks are, etc. I never did a single competition. It doesn't matter. FAANG isn't reaching out to you because you are the #237 LeetCoder in the world.\n* **You gotta learn how to walk before you can run.** It is super discouraging when you start LeetCode for the first time, pick a random question, and then think it's completely mumbo jumbo with no idea how to solve it. In those moments, take a step back, figure out how to solve it - what is the pattern/algorithm/structure/etc - and try again later. You gotta learn it before you can ever try to solve them on your own.\n* **Don't spend more than an hour struggling to find an answer.** There are so many resources out there that say you'll never learn by looking up a solution. And, to be fair, there is some merit to that if you just glance at the solution and that's it. But if you actually take the time to look it up, think about each line of code, what it's doing, read the explanation, walk through examples, etc. It will be worth it. After a while, I would reduce this time. You know you best, if you know you won't get a solution, just move on.\n* **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Getting an optimal solution working by the end is worth as little as 20% of the result.** If I could only pick one mistake I see people making, it is this. Engineers truly love seeing things as black-and-white as possible. Pass/Fail. No middle ground. They think if you get an optimal solution, they've immediately passed. That is not true at all. Sure, it's important, but you NEED to be able to talk about your thought process eloquently. You need to be able to discuss time and space complexities and tradeoffs between different approaches. You need to be able to walk through examples and bugfix on the spot. ALL of this matters. So many people miss 1 problem and think it's all over, or on the contrary, they know they did perfect on finding the optimal solution for the coding problems and are surprised they didn't get an offer. This notion is wildly incorrect. The way you come across in an interview matters a lot.\n\n**How Best To Prepare**\n\nThis particular section may be most helpful for people who struggle with LeetCode. For background, I took \"Algorithms and Data Structures\" in college, and failed the class. The only reason I didn't need to retake it is because a magical curve moved my grade from an F to a D, and that is technically enough to fill the required class. Safe to say, I knew almost nothing when I stared a few months back.\n\n* First thing I did, was PAY for LeetCode. You can either pay $35 a month for Leetcode Premium, or $13.25 a month if you pay for a full year upfront. I chose a full year. I definitely didn't need that, but I don't regret it either. As I've now accepted a role, I'm making way more than that. It was worth the upfront investment. The reason that is critical for people who don't know what they are doing is because they have courses meant to help you learn the concepts, not just rehash them. And also, you can see the Editorials for the problems which will go through various methods of solving each problem as well as time and space complexity analysis. As someone who didn't even understand the concept of time/space complexity this was worth every single goddamn penny.\n* Second thing I did, was the \"Learn\" courses found under the \"Explore\" tab. In this exact order, I did: Arrays 101, Array + String, Queue & Stack, Binary Tree, Recursion I, Recursion II, Graph, Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Heap, N-ary Tree, Trie, Comparator + Sorting.\n   * I highly recommend these courses. They do a great job at quickly explaining the topic, and then giving you problems related to it for you to do it on your own. Take for example, the Recursion II course. They introduce the topic of \"Backtracking\", and then have you immediately work on the N-Queens II problem to make sure you understand the concept. Then, just to be super-duper sure, they give you the template for such problems, before finally, throwing you into the deep end with 3 other Backtracking problems. Now, you can clearly see the name of the section, so you do get a clue that the problem is looking for a backtracking solution. Because of this, it's not the end-all-be-all. You won't get those clues in an interview, but it's great for learning patterns. I'm gonna drill into my head backtracking, backtracking, backtracking, and then what do you know? A few hours later, I know backtracking.\n* Third thing I did, was double down on some concepts I've seen people talking a lot about, \"Merge Intervals\" and \"Permutations\"\n* Fourth thing I did, was drill drill drill. For this, I recommend looking at curated lists with a little bit of everything. Some I found particularly useful were:\n   * Blind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit](https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit)\n   * Grind 169: [https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31](https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31)\n   * Grind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1](https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1)\n   * Neetcode 150: [https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5](https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5)\n   * (I didn't need this one for mobile, but incase it's helpful for others) SQL 45: [https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts](https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts)\n\nOverall, it took about a month and a half just to \"learn\" the things. Then I spent the next month and half just finding different lists to randomly go off of to make sure I stayed on top of it all. By the end of it, Mediums looked easy, and Hards were also looking Easy half the time. But I did **PUT IN THE WORK.** I spent *hours* on this daily. Including weekends. I didn't have much of a life outside of this for a while. If you already know the basic concepts, I doubt you'll need to go quite as hard, but it is possible if you want it. You just *really* have to want it.\n\n# Step 3: System Design (Mobile-Heavy) Round\n\nI often see people talking about this one like it's the hardest of the bunch. Everyone is different, so it might very well be the most difficult for you, but I think a lot of it is it's just the most *unknown* of the bunch. Coding is easy. You just grind out LeetCode for a while, you're probs good. Behavioral - I get it, don't be weird. But system design? What are they even LOOKING for.\n\n* **Engineers love for things to be in black and white - pass / fail, but system design isn't.** Instead, it's a way for the company to figure out what level you are operating at. Are you able to think big-picture like a Senior+ candidate, or are you only able to figure out where the basics fit in? Have you thought about - and probably *seen* a lot of edge cases / error states / etc.? The more detail you can provide, the better.\n* **Talk about the tradeoffs.** \"There are several ways we can store this data. We could use sharedPreferences, or a SQL database like Room, we could also use a NoSQL database. I'm going to go with X because of ABC.\" The more you can talk about your tradeoffs and the real-world experiences you are able to bring alongside that discussion is what truly separates senior+ from mid-.\n* **It's a conversation, not a lesson.** I see so many people make the mistake of going in with a set structure. A general idea of what to talk about is great - requirements, high-level, low-level, issues. But, it's important to note that this interview is NOT black or white. They just sit there talking AT the interviewer instead of working WITH the interviewer.\n* **You want to drive, but don't be afraid of using your interviewer as the GPS.** Take a moment to stop every couple of minutes and just say something like, \"Would you like me to spend more time discussing my reasoning for picking X, or would you like me to move on?\" Or maybe even something like, \"I think the most exciting part to take a deep-dive on is A, but is there something else you were hoping to cover - maybe B or C?\"\n\n**How Best to Prepare for MOBILE System Design**\n\n* **Work on brand new codebases.** Whether it's during your 9-to-5, open-source, side-project, whatever, the more you are thinking about architecting a project from the ground-up the better.\n* **Learn how the big guys are doing things.** Meta has a podcast where they talk about how they've built things to focus on Open Source. Google has blogs on blogs on blogs. ALL of these companies - including non-FAANG like Airbnb - have blogs about why the chose to do something. Or what they did instead once they realized things were not going the way they wanted it to. They typically are talking about tradeoffs at SCALE which is very important for these interviews.\n* **Watch mock interviewers.** I found Alex Lementuev's channel to be a decent resource. There truly isn't a lot of mobile-specific system design support, but he provides some feedback at the end of the interview that is helpful. It's also nice just as a general overview of how these interviews are ran. There's a few others over on YouTube as well. I do truly wish there was something better I could recommend, but unlike Backend / Web, there just isn't a lot out there it seems.\n* **Do mock interviews yourself.** There are several services for this. Find one you like the most, and go for it. Especially if you are unsure about what is expected, or talking in front of people. The more practice you have, the better.\n\n# Step 4: Behavioral Round\n\n* **I wrote up a specific post with more detail on Behavioral here.** [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral\\_interviews\\_are\\_more\\_important\\_than\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral_interviews_are_more_important_than_you/)\n* **Arguably one of the most important rounds for Software Engineers.** Whenever I see someone has been \"down-leveled\" or rejected, the first thing in my mind is *they messed up the behavioral part.* I am truly surprised at how little emphasis is put on this interview.\n* **This round is pivotal in determining which level you will be hired in at.** Just like your resume, you want to make sure your answers are showing impact at the level you are *wanting*, not the level you *have.* Looking for entry-level? You better show you are a good human being. Looking for mid-level? Make sure you highlight your ability to work with little oversight on your work. Senior? What impact are you having on your *team*? Staff+? What impact are you having on your *organization*?\n* **You cannot overprepare for this round.** You probably aren't spending as much time on this as you are LeetCode, but spend some time to really think about good examples in your job that are relevant to the position you are looking to get at the next company. Make sure you are thinking about the STAR method, and framing those examples accordingly. Also, for the love of god, *do not lie*. It is so easy to tell when people are making things up - don't think you are better than others at lying.\n* **Have an equal number of technical and leadership examples if you are looking at Senior+ jobs.** You are still trying for a *technical* leadership position. Don't forget the technical. But also, you are looking for the leadership side of things too. Be well-balanced, for every \"I mentored this person\" there should be a \"I had to walk back this architecture decision here\" kind of a thing.\n\n# Step 4: Team Matching\n\n* **See Step 1 above.** For real, be nice.\n* **Prepare to meet with Hiring Managers.** Similarly to preparing to meet with recruiters, you should also think about your meetings with HMs. This stage is all about finding out if this team is a good fit for you, and you are a good fit for them. What a good team for you looks like may be different than someone else. Think about what *you* need to thrive at work. You generally want to come up with questions for the HM that will help you figure out if the team is a good match for you or not.\n   * Maybe if being in the same office is important to you, you'd ask something like, \"Is the team all located in City X?\"\n   * Or if releasing products into the world is important you may ask something like, \"How often do you guys release updates?\"\n   * If you are motivated by promotions / title changes, you may be thinking about, \"What are the growth opportunities you see for this position?\"\n   * Nowadays, as the power is very much in employers hands, I would stay away from questions like, \"What is the work life balance\", \"What is the tech stack\", etc. unless those things are truly a make-or-break for you.\n* **It's not another interview, but it also kind of is nowadays.** There are way more people in team matching than it seems there are job openings. I've seen some people go from passing to match in 3 days, I've seen others go for 8+ months. You are competing against others, don't be rude. Ask good questions, be genuinely interested in the role. Take the first one you are even someone interested in.\n* **There is an element of luck to it no matter what you do.** We don't know what goes on behind the scenes. It could be that the person needs someone immediately - so they are only looking at candidates who already live in the area. Or maybe they do this one very specific thing in Rust, so they are only looking for people who mentioned that specific thing on their resume, etc. Embrace the craziness that is, try to find others in the same boat as you so you can laugh-cry about it all. Breathe in, breathe out, it will be okay.\n\n# Step 5: Offer and Negotiating\n\n* **You can negotiate often at FAANG, however, you must have data.** You can ask for a bonus of some kind if you are throwing away money to be there. You can ask for a higher salary if you have another offer for such a salary. But you can't just magically negotiate with nothing. Data data data.",

    "raw": "Microsoft Senior SWE Interview Experience (with offer)Here's a detailed breakdown of my recent interview experience with Microsoft. I hope it helps anyone preparing for a similar set of interviews!\n\n* **Microsoft Role:** Senior Software Engineer (Azure)\n* **Hiring Quota:** 5 spots available\n* **My Demographics:** White // Male // Millennial // 6 Years of Experience // US Citizen\n* **Current Role:** Staff SWE // Large startup // Fully remote\n* **Resume:** [https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg)\n* **Microsoft Offer:** Role: Senior SWE (L63) // Base: $176k // Signing Bonus: $15k // Stock: $120k over 4 years // Bonus: 0-30% // Fully remote\n\n# 05/04/2024 - Applied on website (found role on LinkedIn)\n\n# 05/16/2024 - Recruiter Email\n\nIncluded \\~20 questions. Questions were biographical/hr, background/experience, what you're looking for in your next role, and 2 role specific questions.\n\n# 06/18/2024 - Technical Screen\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (hiring manager)\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/) (domain/details were changed but problem was basically the same)\n* **How'd I do?** Fine. Didn't find an optimal solution. Barely found any real solution, tbh. Interviewer stepped in to help many times. I made the key insight to treat the data as a graph and I think that was required not to fail. I was very communicative and that's probably why I passed.\n\n# 07/01/2024 - Onsite Prep\n\n30 minute prep call with recruiter/scheduler.\n\n# 07/02/2024 - Onsite Rounds 1 & 2\n\nRound 1:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineer\n* **What?** 45 min. LeetCode, 15 min system design.\n* **Question?** [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/). Interviewer also expected it to be implemented in an object oriented manor.\n* **How'd I do?** I think I failed this one tbh and it got me down-leveled from 64 -> 63. I gave a solution involving binary search/inserts over a sorted list. Correct answer is min/max heap. It's a commonly known problem and I think the interviewer basically expected me to know it. Positive feedback was that I communicated well and structured the interface well, even if implementation was suboptimal.\n\nRound 2:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)\n* **How'd I do?** Perfect. I coincidentally did this one the day before, and I believe I had more experience than the interviewer.\n\n# 07/03/2024 - Onsite Rounds 3 & 4\n\nRound 3:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 30 min. LeetCode, 30 min system design.\n* **Question?** Basically create a class that lets you add/remove nodes from a tree. Started with coding, then asked to convert to distributed system.\n* **How'd I do?** Very positive feedback on the coding problem (super simple problem, but I think my communication went a long way). Fine feedback on the system design. Basically just had a client, load balancer, service, and database lol.\n\nRound 4:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (different from tech screen)\n* **What?** 15 min. technical/background discussion, 45. min system design.\n* **Question?**  Pretty challenging question about creating a aggregating all data for all tenants in Azure. The hard part is not making too many requests to any tenant/subscription at once (or else you'll rate limit the customer).\n* **How'd I do?** Okay. Was caught off guard since the recruiter told me this round would be all experience/culture. The solution is to query each tenant and add their subscriptions to a queue, then for each subscription in the queue add all their resources to another queue, then for each of those get the data. I tried some sort of Apache Spark scheduling thing to balance between tenants the interviewer didn't like. The interviewer told me the correct answer is to re-enqueue a job every time you hit a rate limit (with some jitter to prevent bunching). I didn't finish in time, but the interviewer gave me an extra hour to finish the whiteboard design and snapshotted it after.\n\n# 07/08/2024 - Initial Offer\n\nNegotiations ongoing.\n\n# 07/15/2024 - Final Offer\n\nOffered $194k base, and I declined the offer.\n\n# LC Stats\n\nFrom Jan 2024 when I started practicing until the day of the first onsite.\n\n* 2.2 problems per day\n* 31 active days\n* 68 solved problems\n* 24 easy (35%)\n* 44 medium (65%)\n* 0 hard (0%)\n* 80 attempts\n* 12 retries\n* 57.51% avg runtime\n* 47.19% avg memory\n* 0:30:20 avg problem\n* 1:15:50 avg day\n* 40:26:48 total time\n\n# My Top Resources\n\n* **LC Problem Selection:** [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)\n* **LC Solutions**: [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode)\n* **System Design Subjects:** [Jordan has no life Systems Design 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwt09KXDH94&list=PLjTveVh7FakLdTmm42TMxbN8PvVn5g4KJ&pp=iAQB)\n* **System Design Strategy:** [Hello Interview: System Design Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdPyoO6aXI&list=PL5q3E8eRUieWtYLmRU3z94-vGRcwKr9tM&pp=iAQB), [Hello Interview: Learn System Design in a Hurry](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* **Other:** [Senior Engineer's Guide To Microsoft's Interview Process and Questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft),",

I knew the problem so it wasn't an issue for me, but I tried to strike a conversation and wanted to make sure that I understood the problem correctly. The interviewer wouldn't speak a word or engage in any conversation.\n\nAfter I write the perfect MaxStack that I can write with my eyes closed, the interviewer wrote in my feedback that my code wasn't appropriate!

    "raw": "My Google Interview ExperienceA few months back, I had my off-campus Google interview for the SWE role. I had like a month to prepare when I received the very first email. I asked some Googlers about their interview experiences and everyone, including on the internet mentioned that Graph and DP are the most asked topics in Google. I solved a lot of problems on DP, graphs, though I focused on other topics as well.\n\nIn first round, I was asked a question on graph. I was able to solve the warm-up as well as follow-up problem. The round went well. In the second round, I was given a 1-D array and solved the problem using two pointers. In the follow-up question, I first gave DP solution, then came up with the most optimal one after a hint given by the interviewer, which was again a two pointers solution.\n\nFew days later, I got call for the final round. This time I was expecting some good DP question. But in this round, I was given two strings. I started with a recursive solution and ended up with a linear solution in the last minute (again using two pointers), but I had no time left to code. I received rejection after few days.\n\nOne thing I learned from this experience is that we should go for an interview open-minded and never expect anything particular from the interview. Just because it's an XYZ company, does not mean it'll ask some advanced problems that you cannot think of under pressure. **It's not about the topic, it's about the concepts and thier implementations.**",

    "raw": "Meta E4 Onsite: RejectedIt's been a long road, but my Meta interview process finally came to an end today. Got the call 2 hours after completing the final interview that I wouldn't be moving forward.\n\nEven though I didn't pass, tbh I'm really proud of how far I've come. When the recruiter reached out to me in October, I hadn't interviewed in over 4 years and had forgotten all my DSA knowledge. Also knew nothing about system design.\n\nFor the next 2 months, I grinded Neetcode Blind 75 like crazy every day and it really paid off. Had my phone screen in January and couldn't believe it when I passed. Started grinding system design for 2-3 hours every single day to ramp up for the onsite as fast as possible. Never did SD before so this was all new to me. Did probably 30 peer mocks using Pramp and Exponent, as well as HelloInterview where I got really helpful feedback from real Meta interviewers.\n\nFinally had my onsite this week - 2 coding, 1 SD, 1 behavioral. I felt like I rocked the coding interviews, all thanks to Neetcode so was really happy about that. SD was definitely my weakest area as this was my first time doing it, feel like I didn't pass that one. Behavioral went good I thought.\n\nUltimately I think I had a chance, but since hiring is so competitive these days, and I've heard Meta is pausing E4 hiring (not sure if that's true), any weaknesses I had probably got magnified tenfold. It is what it is, at least I can relax now.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Neetcode is a national treasure and needs to be protected at all costs. What makes him great is not his ability to solve problems, but his ability to explain and break down problems, which I think is what interviewers actually value\n* Unless you're a genius, it is physically not possible to learn all of System Design in 1 month. This is because it's not enough to just study the basics, you need to go over several case studies so you're familiar with all types of systems, which is extremely time-consuming\n* Try as much as possible to do mocks with people who are better than you or have actually interviewed people before. They will give you the harsh feedback that is required to get better\n\nEdit: Just came across my [post from 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17o0l8v/how_to_approach_blind_75/).

I answered almost 90% of the questions correctly regarding python, deep learning, AI etc. \n\nNow this is a local company and has a set of very popular intelligence questions they ask everyone. A few of my friends that were interviewed there got asked the same questions each time so I knew. \n\nOne of these is: 'what's the angle between two hands of a clock at 3:15'. I even had the answer to this memorized, let alone the procedure. Obviously I didn't want the recruiter knowing this, so I did act a little confused at first before solving it. But apparently he caught on to it, because he then asked me to calculate the angle at 5:30. Because of this unexpected follow up and the interview pressure, my mind completely went blank. I couldn't even picture how 5:30 looks on the clock. I did reach the solution (i.e. 15 deg) but with a lot of help from the interviewer. He asked me to calculate the angle for 7:25 afterwards, for which I couldn't come up with anything even after thinking for like 5-6mins. \n\nHe'd figured out that I had the answer memorized, cause he kept saying during the follow up questions that, 'how did you solve the 3:15 one so easily? Use the same technique for this one as well, it's simple.'\n\nI felt so stupid for not practicing a general method for solving a question of this nature. The method I had in mind was specific to the 3:15 problem, so I was stumped on the other two qs. But at least I did learn a thing or two out of this experience. ",

You really need to practice problem solving under time constraints and the pressure of another person assessing you while you're trying to think.\n\nI was given leetcode #283 and for the life of me, I kind of froze, could not come up with any solution in my head other than creating a new array to place the non-zero elements. I needed tons of hints from the interviewer to solve the question. Eventually I coded up a working, in-place solution but it took 40 minutes. His feedback was that I did good at verifying the solution and fixing bugs along the way, as well as the fact that I actually was able to eventually code the solution. But he said it was quite frankly an easy warm up question and I really struggled with it, didn't even get to the second harder question he had planned, so I wouldn't have passed.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed considering I've been solving leetcode problems for the past 6 months, and even made an excel sheet with the top 75 Meta tagged questions that I've been going over these past 2 weeks.

    "raw": "Meta interview experience and preparation tips (London)Hey everyone, I've just secured a Meta IC4 role and wanted to share my experience and preparation process.  \nFor context, I have 9 YOE, mostly working at no-name companies doing full stack roles. I'm currently 2.5 years into my current role (startup) and haven't interviewed anywhere during that time. I also never did leetcode style interviews in the past.\n\nFrom receiving the initial call to final loop decision, it was a total of 8 weeks.\n\n# Screening\n\nFirst 2 weeks, did all the prep work material on the meta careers website.  \nTip: instead of watching the videos on the website look for the equivalent ones in hackerrank's youtube channel, they're also done by Gayle and have pretty much the same content, but much higher quality.\n\nAfter 2 weeks I had my mock interview.  \nDid ok, solved first problem and brute forced 2nd.  \nAt the end interviewer mentioned I was close to passing but **my code was not clean enough**.\n\nAfter this bought Leetcode premium and did 2 full weeks of just Meta top asked questions.  \nDid maybe 2-5 per day depending on how tired I was, as I didn't want to risk burning out.\n\nCome screening day, I got two variations of questions that I had seen before (mediums), solved them ok and proceeded to next round.\n\nTips:\n\n* -Make sure you write **clean** code, no unnecessary if's, no unnecessary variables, well named functions/variables, good identation to make it easier to read.\n* Always run a manual test case, this is your oportunity to catch bugs and fix them yourself before the interviewer intervenes.\n* Think out loud, this one is super important to keep your interviewer in the loop of what you're thinking. Sometimes your brain may be thinking one thing and you write another, this way they at least know what you were trying to do. (I do this often, saying \"A > B\", but write \"A < B\" or something like that). You can even just say read what you're typing out loud, that's fine and helps convey your thought process. I found it also helps me calm down my nerves, as the silence makes it worse.\n\n# Final loop\n\nI had 4 weeks to prepare for the final loop.\n\n**Product design**\n\nTo prepare for the Product Design interview I used: \n\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/@hello\\_interview/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hello_interview/videos)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk\\_bGCTde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk_bGCTde)\n\nTried a few others too, but ultimately these gave me the most bang for buck.\n\nI watched one just to get a hang of the process and then for all subsequent ones, I first tried to resolve it myself on Excalidraw and then watched the video and updated my design where it made sense.\n\nI spent the majority of the first 2 weeks on this.\n\n**Behavioural**\n\nFor preparing for behavioural it was a mix of watching random youtube videos and using the AI tool from hello interview: [https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai](https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai)\n\nI didn't apply the STAR method, and instead tried to set up my examples as *stories* and tried to make it interesting for the interviewer to listen to.\n\nI didn't spend much time on this, maybe 2 days.  \nIn hindsight, this was not enough.\n\n**Coding**\n\nIn the final 2 weeks, I could feel myself getting a bit rusty in regards to coding and started panicking.  \nI then spent the majority of the final two weeks doing more LC top last 6 months Meta tagged questions.\n\nIn hindsight this was too much.\n\n**Final interviews**\n\nI booked both coding for the same day.  \nThe first interview went very well, connected well with interviewer and solved both problems optimally with time to spare.  \nI don't remember seeing either of them, but I reckon LC medium.\n\nThe 2nd interview wasn't as good, solved the first exercise optimally but only brute forced the second one.\n\nOn the 2nd day I had behavioural + product design.\n\nBehavioural went *ok*, interviewer was mostly reading questions from a script which felt a bit off as the interview didn't have much flow.\n\nProduct design also wasn't perfect. I did connect better with the interviewer and we bounced ideas off each other, but overall I felt that time went by VERY quickly.  \nTip: Make sure you practice resolving these on a timer. Aim to be able to complete an end to end design in 30ish minutes, including deep dives.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nHad a call with the recruiter 3 days later.  \nOverall they were happy with my performance, and I ended up in between IC4 and IC5 as I ranked IC4 for behavioural and IC5 for product design.  \nI was suprised at getting the IC5 signal, as I thought I needed a perfect design to do so, but that **is not the case**.\n\nIn the end I was placed at IC4, which is a down level from my current role but then again my current role is not at FAANG and I've never worked at FAANG either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI found the process to be really good and well organised. The interviews are difficult, but they really want you to be able to present your best self and give you a lot of time and materials to prepare.\n\nOverall it was good that I managed to pass the interviews with a full time job and two toddlers, so there wasn't much time for preparing.   \nI did have to forfeit hobbies or other distractions during this time though.\n\nBut if I could do it, so can you!",

The only available time for the meeting was within 24 hours and I agreed. I spent the rest of the day and the following morning reviewing basic technical questions, general behavioral questions etc. I felt pretty confident going into the interview. One thing to note was that when I went to re-read what the position was that I was applying for, it was taken down and I couldn't access my application as it was locked, which was a bit concerning.\n\nIt was a 30 minute zoom interview which was scheduled with the manager of the department I was applying for and 3 other engineers on the team.\n\nBecause it was a 30 minute interview, I assumed it was just a screening--which it was, but since it was over zoom I still obviously dressed well and turned my camera on etc. I join the meeting a minute before the start time, and slowly waited for people to join. Took a few minutes, but before we started I realized I was just staring at myself and no one had their cameras on. Again, this is my *first* ever interview, so I don't know if this is normal? It felt extremely awkward from the get go.\n\nThey ask me some background about myself, why I'm interested in their company, which I genuinely was; it's an aerospace company, and I actually did my first year of college in aerospace, so it's something I'm relatively passionate about.\n\nAfter finishing that, it was just dead silent for about 30 seconds, and then \"Well, okay, can you explain one of these projects on your resume?\" Which I then proceeded to do, and explained the lifetime of the project, its goals and outcomes, challenges I faced and how I solved them etc.\n\nFor context, the project was a real-time album art displayer that was built with python and JavaScript which used an LED matrix and a Raspberry Pi, synchronized with Spotify through the Developer API. (There's more to the project, but that's really the only software integrated with hardware project I'd worked on so far, everything else is just purely software).\n\nI expressed a lot of interest in this project and was genuinely hoping for some reaction to it but again there was no visual cues as to what was going on, so I just sat there waiting for someone to ask something, which after a while was only asked if I'd worked on anymore projects with physical hardware implementation which I reluctantly responded with \"No, this was the first experience I'd had with it\" etc.\n\nI then explained another project I had done which was a website I built for my photography portfolio (side hobby / job of mine) using HTML, JS, MySQL, PHP and CSS. This was only responded to with, \"Well it's good that you also do your own projects too.\"\n\nAfter that, I was asked \"What's your favorite and least favorite part about Computer Science?\" This felt so... broad? I genuinely tried to give a good answer, saying I really enjoy building things with software that you can then interact with physically, but stumbled on what my \"least favorite part\" about CS was.\n\nThen I was asked, \"Do you know any legacy languages\" which I do not. So I responded with \"No, that's not something I've delved into myself, and along my college career we've only used more modern languages\".\n\nAwkward pause, then turned it to me to ask questions. I asked some things about what it's like interning for them, what kind of tasks you take on, how do you work as a team as an intern, and if there were any projects that they'd worked on that they found interesting (not sure if I should of asked the last one). Basically, the manager had to keep \"poking\" them by saying things like \"Do you guys want to chime in and answer?\" to which I got pretty bland responses like \"Yea we work as a team and there's always people you can talk to\".\n\nAfter that it wrapped up, I said thank you etc. and they said \"Alright, well that's about it. Bye.\" and left.\n\nI know this is an extremely lengthy post but I just cannot get it off my mind. It just felt so awkward, like they really did *not* care at all, and I really do feel like I had to have messed something up. They didn't ask *any* technical questions, and said they mostly work LabVIEW and... don't really program much so that was interesting.\n\nI don't know how to feel in all honesty. Just felt like getting it off my chest because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since the meeting earlier today. I don't really expect to hear anything worthwhile back, and it was a good learning experience, but man I really just feel like I somehow flopped.",

    "raw": "Meta's Product Design Vs System Design interviewI\u2019ve been looking for resources comparing/contrasting Meta's Product Design and System Design interviews and here\u2019s what I found.\n\n[This](https://thinksoftware.medium.com/grokking-the-product-design-vs-system-design-interviews-419520a65d49)\u00a0Medium article seems to say I should be focusing on product requirements, customer impact, API details, and roadmap.\n\nIt also says \u201cDon\u2019t go into discussing the architectural implementation\u201d, which differs from what I heard form my recruiter to still touch on those points without dwelling too much on them (show breadth of knowledge).\n\n[This](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook)\u00a0interviewing.io article mentions\u00a0nothing\u00a0about customer focus, and instead says the focus should be data modeling and API params/response structure, but otherwise is similar to System Design\n\n[This](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/meta-system-vs-product-design?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=product-vs-system)\u00a0hellointerview.com article has a bit of both, mentioning APIs, data modeling,\u00a0and\u00a0user experience as the primary concerns.

Should I just touch on it briefly, or is it worth discussing some tradeoffs there?\n* Should the frontend be discussed at all?\n* I can\u2019t seem to find any mock interviews for this, so I\u2019ve been watching/listening system design interviews on my commute, and trying to think how I would alter it for product design. Ideally, I would like to hear/see at least\u00a0**one**\u00a0good example of a successful product design interview. Any leads on where I might find mock Product design interviews?\n* When discussing the API, is it worth mentioning error codes, versioning, async tasks, and other niche topics?\n* Should I discuss gathering user metrics to inform decisions?\n* In a similar vein should I be\u00a0focusing on the \u201csoft design\u201d (i.e.\u00a0product requirements, customer impact, and future roadmap), or stick more to the \"hard design\u201d (i.e. API and data models)?\n\nThanks in advance! My interview is Jan9 & 10\n\nP.S. Yes, I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17xjdgb/what_the_hell_is_the_difference_between_metas/) post, but I'm still unclear about the above questions\n\nUPDATE: So I took the interview, I passed, but at IC4 level. They weren't allowed to give any feedback, which sucks because I'd love to know where I fell short\n\nThe question centered around one feature, and since I used websockets I actually didn't have much of an API. So all that info about being API-centric (i.e. [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook),  [hellointerview](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/meta-system-vs-product-design?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=product-vs-system), and [this](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1173258/product-design-vs-systems-design-interview-at-fb-looking-for-study-prep-suggestions) leetcode comment from below) wasn't so applicable in my case.\n\nIt was pretty much a system design interview.

    "raw": "Interview Prep & Company Experiences - Detailed post**LONG POST ALERT. But worth it I promise.**\n\nI commented on a couple of posts and was asked a lot of questions about my interview prep and other details so decided on creating a post. Also I will keep adding details to this post as I remember details or get asked questions.  Please be kind. It took me forever to write this.\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This is how I prepared. Might not be the best approach for you but you can take this as another data point and see if you can improve on it or add it to your method of preparation.\n\n**About me**: 5 YOE, started preparing Jan 2022. Worked at Kindle, Alexa and AWS for all of that time and joining Google(L5 - Senior) in 2 weeks. Interviewed for a total of 11 companies and got an offer(or moved to offer stage) from 8 of those.\n\n# Preparation\n\n**Intro Call -** This is the first call with HR or the recruiter for the company. Most of the people don't prepare for this. And honestly you don't need to as long as you are clear in what you want from the interview process. Keep a short description of your work/role ready. Second, make sure you know what role you want to apply for and why are you looking for a change. If it is Senior you are targeting then mention that. Even if Recruiter says levelling is determined by interview performance you should mention that you are looking for Senior. Do not provide answers like I am looking for senior but will be okay with downlevel. Some recruiters might also ask your area of expertise (Frontend, backend, cloud etc). I had 5 bullet points which conveyed all of the information above. Everybody knows how to identify red flags but sometimes in the flow of things you might provide one which you will think about later. So keep information written and avoid speaking from outside of it.\n\n**Coding -** Alright so this is the obvious one. A lot of it is repetitive but I liked it since it made my speed of solving questions and understanding patterns better. I started with understanding concepts using Algoexpert since I was overwhelmed by the number of different type of problems when I opened leetcode. I was not bad but every time I solved a new type of problem I always had a question of have I solved all types now? So I went through major concepts in AlgoExpert all the while also solving leetcode equivalents (Easy + Mediums and only doing a couple hards every once in a few days in the beginning). Once I went through \\~75% of Algoexpert then I stopped using it in favor of leetcode. You can also use Neetcode or other methods instead of Algoexpert for concepts. No replacement of leetcode found for me lol. Some ways with which I improved problem over problem:\n\n1. Even though I solved a problem with ease, look at the provided solution and discussion board to understand better / other ways of solving something. This helps in sharpening your brain and maybe one approach would be faster and other would be less prone to errors etc.\n2. No IDE. I coded directly on leetcode without autocomplete. There is something comforting about being able to solve questions without any help and it paid off when all these companies had their own tool to test you.\n3. Time. I used leetcode timer to track how I was doing. 15 mins easy, 20 mins medium and 30 hard. I used to exceed the limits in the beginning but as time passed I was able to do more problems in the stipulated time. Start the timer when you start reading the question.\n4. Decide on approach and think about it fully before starting to code. Helps build critical thinking and fail fast habit. If you are able to think of failure scenarios before you are coding then you my friend are elite. I struggled in this one.\n5. Speak. This will sound weird but yeah, talk aloud when solving new questions since you will have to do it in an interview. I had multiple friends not crack interviews because they felt like telling each and every step of what you are doing is pointless. It might be in application development but not when you are proving to another person that you have what it takes.\n6. Structure your code and have proper variable names. There are rounds in certain companies which take this into account. Specially FAANG.\n7. And lastly, be humble. If you are able to solve more questions today than yesterday, keep that momentum going and do not let it get to your head. I struggled with this one in the beginning too lol.\n\nI solved company questions days before I interviewed for them and not before. Except Meta. Only solve company questions for that. Reasons listed below under company.\n\n**System Design -** You might or might not have this round based on the level you are interviewing for and the company. For this one if you have designed systems for your current employer then you are already half done. I had designed systems before but I wanted to know what is the structure of the interview and how to tackle questions all within an hour. Also obviously the different types of ambiguous questions you can get. I went through Alex Xu's System design interview book. (I used to read it when I got bored of coding or for breaks between coding days). It is the perfect starter. Moved on to Systems Expert and Grokking the system design. Each tool has something unique to provide.\n\n1. Alex Xu - simplified beginner stuff. Amazing if you want to dive in and read from scratch. Also the best chapter is the first one. Scaling.\n2. Systems Expert - Great for explanations and how do you move from topic to topic in interview. Understanding -> Requirements -> Data -> HLD -> Tradeoffs -> Questions -> Rewind\n3. Grokking - The types of problems and width of knowledge.\n4. Just taking up any random software you see and try to build it and then search. This is a true test. I picked up unconventional designs for practice like Query execution platform for a cloud DB, Robinhood, credit Karma or even IOS software update rollout.\n\nIf you are interviewing for something above L5 or an experienced L5 then you will need more material for depth as well. PS: Invest in a whiteboard if you can. Helps when you can draw things in 3 seconds when compared to 10.\n\n**Behavioural -** Not much here but keep examples of what you have done in the past ready. Some  Some common topics are:\n\n1. Your experience or projects you have worked in.\n2. Lead a project. How did you manage timelines, work with multiple people, how did the delivery of project go etc.\n3. Conflict Resolution. How did you solve arguments between you and others or between 2 people of your team.\n4. Best Practices. Your views about them and how to bring best practices in the team.\n\n**Offer Negotiation -** Congratulations you have moved to this stage. Make sure to have some numbers handy but don't provide the recruiter the numbers. Do your research about how much does a company pay for location, level and YOE. Check [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) for this. Get competing offers. Do not lie about offers since some companies ask for proof like Google. Try to schedule interviews such that you are getting offers around the same time. This can be discussed in intro call when the Recruiter tells you the process and how long it generally takes. You can ask for more time if required. All the best!\n\n# Interview Experiences\n\n**Google (Accepted offer L5) -** One of the best experiences I had. Every Interviewer was accommodating and all but one were a pleasure to talk to. Coding (3 rounds) was Mediums and Hard. I did good on 2 and did okay on one. They used some variation of google docs which I hated for interviews but here coding directly in leetcode helped. Solving company tagged questions based on frequency was a hit or miss. System Design was amazing. They asked me a question I had not solved before but luckily I was able to use some experience from the past and my prep to build solutions and talk about trade offs. The System Design interviewer was very accommodating and let me use a white board I had and kept taking notes so I don't have to draw on google docs. Focus is more on approach and how you tackle patterns rather than the final solution. Pro Tip: If you have experience and show that in Intro call you can ask to skip phone screen. I did the same. Getting full loop scheduled is always the best.\n\n**Meta (Offer high E5) -** Very different from Google. Focus is on **speed** and accuracy and not on approach. Solving company tagged questions was a 100% hit on phone screen plus actual coding rounds. This is also based on my friend's experiences as well. Speed is in bold because you are expected to solve 2 mediums in 35-40 mins. I hated the system design round. I read about this before that Meta system design interviewers are like a wall but my god. No expressions or words and me talking for 20 mins straight at a time. Not fun but helped me in subsequent interviews. I was told my performance here is what got me down levelled since I killed it in the coding rounds. Pro tip: when asked in interview to introduce yourself, do it in under 30 seconds. Do not take your own time away from coding / system design unless details are asked.\n\n**Microsoft (Offer 63) -** Very team specific interviews for some reason. I was asked a lot of coding questions that were related to OS. Scheduling etc (Leetcode Mediums). System design was very non generic. Again asked very OS style design. I was able to answer but was not confident until I got the offer call. Overall my experience was not great since I had to follow up with recruiter multiple times and they were not willing to give me more than a couple days in deciding on offer. I wonder if they were worried that I will not accept Microsoft if I get other offers. It is a great company, not sure why would they do that. Also heavy focus on YOE? I had to fight for the 63 round of interviews since recruiter said 62 is more suited for my YOE.\n\n**LinkedIn (Offer Staff) -** Great questions and people again. A healthy mix of company tagged questions (Leetcode mediums and one Hard total) and some new ones of well known concepts. System Design was great as it felt more like a discussion. Question was a bit unconventional so not sure if I performed great or okay. I had to give 2 days of interviews since I was first interviewed for a Senior and then Staff based on performance. The second was was a steep increase in difficulty and depth of knowledge test specially in System Design. Pro Tip: I missed mentioning which level I want to interview for here and since interviews differ by level in LinkedIn, mention it during recruiter call.\n\n**Uber (Offer L5A) -** By far the hardest interview in terms of coding. I was asked a total of 4 questions(2 mediums and 2 hards) in 2 interviews total. I had seen 1 medium before and knew how to solve the other medium and hard. The second hard was tricky and related to path finding. I got to know the optimal way of solving very late and then was not able to solve the full thing but conveyed my approach. System Design went okay. I did not have a good time with the interviewer here since to me it felt like after every 10 mins he would mention how great Uber is and the complexity of problems they solve there. I understand that a team/company might be doing something great but it should affect how you conduct interviews negatively. I would have deciding to go to Uber if I did not have a bad experience in that interview since I found out that the interviewer was going to be my colleague in the team.\n\n**Stripe (Offer L3) -** Best interview experience so far. Very different. No leetcode style questions. Simple questions which check how do you do development tasks and regular day to day dev work. I wish other orgs take this approach. Coding was very simple. Bug bash was good if you follow a structured approach and know how to use debugger of your favourite IDE. Integration was straight forward as well. What I really loved was the System Design. It felt natural and like I am actually designing a system at my current work. Kudos to Stripe for making the interview process so good.\n\n**Twitter (Offer Senior) -** Not much tips to give here. It was a simple interview process and the coding questions were 90% from the leetcode tagged questions list with a minor twist here and there. System Design was simple as well and was asked a very well known question. The only thing that was checked in my view was how deep I could go in data storage and access patterns.\n\n**Doordash (Offer E5) -** Almost all questions were from company tagged leetcode. Focus was on accuracy and edge cases. Good interview experience in terms of coding. System Design was very doordash products specific but can be solved if you have done all questions of grokking series. Nothing out of the ordinary here. If I had to rate the difficulty with Uber being 9/10, this would be a 4/10 along with Microsoft.\n\n**Databricks (Painful Rejection) -** Loooong process which takes forever to complete. Recruiter call -> Phone Screen -> Manager call -> Interviews -> Take home assignment -> Reference checks. I had fun till the Take home assignment since the interview questions were challenging but made sense and not your regular trick leetcode hards. Take home assignment was a lot of fun too since I actually learned new tricks while solving it during the course of 2 days. But why reference checks which need to include an ex manager? They pestered all the contacts I provided and grilled them with unnecessary questions. I was rejected based on reference checks? Pro tip: Do not interview here unless you actually wanna go here no matter what.\n\n**Upcoming Startup (Rejected, cannot name for some reasons) -** I was just done with interviewing by this point and tired. Also I had less motivation since I already had some offers. Shame because that means I wasted time of the interviewers. During one of the coding questions I blanked and was not even able to give a brute force approach. Bad day for me. Lesson: never interview more than required. There is definitely such a thing as mental tiredness.\n\n**ByteDance (Ghosted) -** The interview was split in 2 rounds. 2 coding and then after clearing that 1 more coding and system design etc. I cleared the 2 coding where questions were completely new but like Medium/Medium-Hard. Recruiter scheduled the next round of interviews the week after and sent a mail day before cancelling the interviews and said would reschedule. Never heard back even after sending multiple mails? Weird.\n\nYou can ask me questions below and I will try to answer or add it to the post here.",

    "raw": "Goolge Software Eng Interview Experience(L4 to L3 downlevel)\nHey everyone.\n\nI was reached out by a Recruiter in early December for an L4 role. All interviews (1 phone screen and 3 coding and 1 behavioural) happened. The feedback was:\n\nPhone screen: hire for L4, strong hire for L3. He said if code was modular, it would have been SH.\n\nRound 1: Hire\n\nRound 2:, No Hire\n\nRound 3: Kinda mixed. Lean hire for L4 but debugging, coding etc were very good. He asked a warm up & the main problem. But in feedback, he said he had one more problem to ask and hence gave lean L4.\n\nBehavioural: recruiter said it's positive and interviewer gave good feedback.\n\nExtra Coding round: I asked recruiter to have one more round to compensate No Hire round. She said it's positive(didn't mention it was hire/lean hire).\n\nDue to No Hire round, had a few team matching before going to hiring committee. 2 HMs showed interest(after team match call), out of which 1 position got closed. The other HM approved and the packet went to hiring committee.\n\nThe hiring committee gave Hire for L3 but No hire for L4.\n\nThe no hire interviewer fuc\\*\\*d me.\n\n**Background**: He asked a simple range max problem on array. To which I gave segment tree solution. Now during explanation he asked me to prove why\u00a0**search**\u00a0is logN, which I explained intuitively(like we divide the array in half each time and store answer, max height of tree will be logN). He said if during search query(l, r) you are going\u00a0*max(query(l, mid), query(mid+1, r))*, here you are going both side of tree so how come it will be logN. I said it will go left/right some constant number of times and eventually some range will satisfy and it won't go further.\n\nbut then he said \"I understand what you are saying, but your answer is not conclusive and you need to prove mathematically\". Which I tried and couldn't do.\n\nThen during implementation it took me 4-5 minutes to write build function (last time I implemented it was in 2019 :( ) and missed the base condition, he pointed it out and I fixed it. Solution was completed. He said looks good.\n\nBut in feedback this guy wrote very bad feedback like:\n\n1. Gave solution but couldn't explain complexity. Fine\n2. He exaggerated the base condition miss in feedback : \"implemented a solution which would run infinitely and candidate fixed it only after explicitly pointing out...\". Even though during interview he simply asked me, when will this function stop and I quickly realised, explained and fixed it.\n\nI know it's my fault as well for 2nd round that I was slow but I really hate the feedback given by the interviewer. It's very tough to prove some things like greedy solutions, algo's like randomized quick sort will be NlogN etc. Idk why he judged purely based on one simple thing. It just frustrates me, I feel no amount of preparation could have saved me from that \"prove mathematically\" question he asked.\n\n\n\nDue to which the HC feedback says that the \"candidate took more time during implementation and hence not going with L4, but L3. They did not consider the extra round saying 'coming up with solution was slow for 2nd round and additional round cann't compensate that'\" like what bro. It depends on problem as well. How can you judge the problem solving based on 1 thing.\n\nI have around \\~2.5 years of experience at a mid size product startup as SDE2.\n\nMy Current base is above 25, no stocks. is it worth joining as L3? India.\n\nWasted a lot of my time, the process started in Jan and it's april :(\n\nI am looking for a change rn, have applied at several places but mostly get Thank you:(\n\nLooking for suggestions, what I should do.

    "raw": "July LeetCode Recap# A Little About Me\n\nI\u2019m a Software Engineer/DevOps with six years of experience, currently working at a reputable company. My goal is to secure a higher-paying job within the next year to start paying off my student loans. One of my main challenges has been LeetCode-style questions, which have hindered my progress toward better opportunities.\n\nI've struggled with technical interviews at companies like Visa, American Express, JPMorgan, and Amazon due to my inability to complete algorithmic problems within time constraints. After recently not succeeding in an Amazon interview, I decided it was time to take my preparation for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), LeetCode, and System Design seriously.\n\nIn January, I began documenting my progress, which I\u2019m turning into a monthly recap series. I hope this will help others on a similar journey while also serving as a personal journal for when I finally reach my goal.\n\n# Past Recap\n\n* [January](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1ifawa3/first_milestone/)\n* [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1j0e2e3/february_leetcode_recap/)\n* [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1jo3qii/march_leetcode_recap/)\n* [April](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1kblu6l/april_leetcode_recap/)\n* [May](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1l7564p/may_leetcode_recap/)\n* [June](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lplk1x/june_leetcode_recap/)\n\n# July Progress\n\nThis month, my original plan to focus on Sliding Window problems kind of went out the window\u2014no pun intended. I fell back into an old habit of trying to do too much at once, which led to feeling overwhelmed. During this time, I also realized that I still had gaps in some foundational concepts, like sorting, which I hadn\u2019t fully grasped yet.\n\nOne big realization, something I\u2019ve noticed before but really hit home again, is how understanding and implementing different algorithms and data structures can unlock solutions to a single problem in multiple ways. That awareness helped me pivot my approach.\n\nI decided to slow down and follow the Neetcode path more deliberately, and it\u2019s been a huge relief. It\u2019s helped reduce a lot of the stress and anxiety I was feeling. I\u2019ve started to grasp solutions much faster now because I\u2019m making sure to **really** understand the underlying DSA concepts instead of just trying to \"brute force\" my way through problems.\n\nI\u2019ve also come to accept that my journey might take longer than it does for others and I\u2019m genuinely okay with that. What matters is the progress. I'm proud that I was able to complete the entire Array/Hashing section in Neetcode, solving around 90% of it by myself.\n\n# Goals for August\n\n* Review past LeetCode questions I've attempted\n* Focus on mastering sorting algorithms:\n   * Insertion Sort\n   * Merge Sort\n   * Quick Sort\n   * Bucket Sort\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIn August I\u2019ll slow the pace a bit to focus on reviewing previous questions, ensuring I have a solid grasp of the concepts. I\u2019ll also be working specifically on Sorting and other DSA concepts.\n\nSee you all next month!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfodtxw4o0hf1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=68902c56793d51ca55884cae6c5b2063a3ef485f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf0lg3m8o0hf1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=446b1f61cf13734de1ff78754de9826a3606b00f\n\n  \n",

Google's interview patterns shifted significantly after their recent hiring freeze ended. The bar hasn't lowered, it's become more predictable. Interviewers now pull from a tighter pool of problems, especially for initial screens.\n\n# The 50 Questions (Ranked by Actual Frequency)\n\n# Tier 1: The Absolute Must-Knows (Appear in 40%+ of interviews)\n\nThese ten problems dominate Google interview questions coding reports:\n\n1. **\\[200\\] Number of Islands** (BFS/DFS) - 47% frequency\n2. **\\[146\\] LRU Cache** (design) - 45% frequency\n3. **\\[42\\] Trapping Rain Water** (two-pointers/stack) - 43% frequency\n4. **\\[56\\] Merge Intervals** (sorting) - 42% frequency\n5. **\\[297\\] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree** (design) - 41% frequency\n6. **\\[139\\] Word Break** (DP) - 39% frequency\n7. **\\[133\\] Clone Graph** (graph/BFS-DFS) - 38% frequency\n8. **\\[208\\] Implement Trie** (design) - 37% frequency\n9. **\\[239\\] Sliding Window Maximum** (monotonic deque) - 36% frequency\n10. **\\[560\\] Subarray Sum Equals K** (prefix + hashmap) - 35% frequency\n\n# Tier 2: High Frequency (Weekly appearances in reports)\n\nThese show up in 20-35% of **Google coding interview questions**:\n\n1. **\\[23\\] Merge k Sorted Lists** (heap/merge)\n2. **\\[128\\] Longest Consecutive Sequence** (hashing)\n3. **\\[295\\] Find Median from Data Stream** (two heaps)\n4. **\\[380\\] Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)** (design)\n5. **\\[394\\] Decode String** (stack)\n6. **\\[269\\] Alien Dictionary** (topological sort)\n7. **\\[340\\] Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct** (sliding window)\n8. **\\[417\\] Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** (multi-source BFS/DFS)\n9. **\\[684\\] Redundant Connection** (union-find)\n10. **\\[494\\] Target Sum** (DP/subset sum)\n\n# Tier 3: The Differentiators (L5+ and final rounds - 10-20% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[4\\] Median of Two Sorted Arrays** (binary search on answer)\n2. **\\[10\\] Regular Expression Matching** (DP)\n3. **\\[218\\] The Skyline Problem** (sweep line/heap)\n4. **\\[224\\] Basic Calculator** (stack/parsing)\n5. **\\[282\\] Expression Add Operators** (backtracking)\n6. **\\[315\\] Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** (BIT/merge sort)\n7. **\\[332\\] Reconstruct Itinerary** (Eulerian path)\n8. **\\[460\\] LFU Cache** (design)\n9. **\\[685\\] Redundant Connection II** (union-find + directed)\n10. **\\[727\\] Minimum Window Subsequence** (DP/two-pass)\n\n# Tier 4: The Specialists (System design coding hybrids - 5-10% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[31\\] Next Permutation** (array manipulation)\n2. **\\[57\\] Insert Interval** (intervals)\n3. **\\[212\\] Word Search II** (Trie + DFS)\n4. **\\[240\\] Search a 2D Matrix II** (2-pointer grid)\n5. **\\[261\\] Graph Valid Tree** (union-find/BFS)\n6. **\\[271\\] Encode and Decode Strings** (design)\n7. **\\[310\\] Minimum Height Trees** (graph trimming)\n8. **\\[329\\] Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix** (DFS + memoization)\n9. **\\[336\\] Palindrome Pairs** (trie/hashing)\n10. **\\[354\\] Russian Doll Envelopes** (LIS variant)\n11. **\\[363\\] Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K** (prefix + TreeSet)\n12. **\\[378\\] Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix** (heap/binary search)\n13. **\\[399\\] Evaluate Division** (graph/union-find)\n14. **\\[406\\] Queue Reconstruction by Height** (greedy sorting)\n15. **\\[421\\] Maximum XOR of Two Numbers** (bit trie)\n16. **\\[425\\] Word Squares** (trie/backtracking)\n17. **\\[480\\] Sliding Window Median** (heaps/balanced BST)\n18. **\\[490\\] The Maze** (BFS/DFS variants)\n19. **\\[652\\] Find Duplicate Subtrees** (tree hashing)\n20. **\\[668\\] Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table** (binary search on answer)\n\n# Patterns We've Noticed\n\nAfter tracking hundreds of Google interview reports, clear patterns emerged:\n\n**Phone Screens (45 minutes):** 82% pull from Tiers 1-2. Expect one medium, possibly escalating to medium-hard. Islands (200) and LRU Cache (146) dominate here, they appeared in 47% and 45% of phone screens respectively\n\n**Onsite Round 1-2:** Mix of Tier 1-2 with occasional Tier 3. The focus stays on clean implementation. Sliding window problems (340, 239) spike here\n\n**Onsite Round 3-4:** Tier 3-4 problems emerge. This is where Skyline (218) or Expression operators (282) separate L4 from L5+ candidates\n\n**Time Management:** Our data shows successful candidates average 25 minutes for Tier 1-2 problems, 35 minutes for Tier 3-4. Nobody expects perfect solutions for the hardest ones, clean approach with solid complexity analysis matters more\n\n# What's Changed in 2025\n\nComparing 2024 to 2025 Google technical interview questions, three shifts stand out:\n\n1. **Graph problems surged 30%** Union-find specifically jumped from 8% to 14% frequency. Problems like Redundant Connection (684, 685) moved from rare to regular\n2. **Pure DP decreased** Classic DP like Edit Distance dropped 40% in frequency. Google now prefers DP hidden within other patterns (Word Break, Target Sum)\n3. **Design hybrids exploded** LRU/LFU Cache, Serialize trees, Encode/Decode strings, these coding+design problems now appear in 35% of interviews, up from 20% last year\n\n# How to Use This List Effectively\n\nBased on successful candidate patterns:\n\n**Week 1-2:** Master Tier 1. These ten problems aren't just frequent, they teach the core patterns for everything else. Do each one three times: brute force, optimized, then from memory\n\n**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2. Focus on pattern recognition. When you see \"k distinct elements,\" think sliding window. \"Find median of stream\" always means two heaps\n\n**Week 5-6:** Sample Tier 3-4 based on your target level. L3-L4? Touch them lightly. L5+? These differentiate you\n\n**Daily routine:** Our data shows successful candidates practiced 3-4 problems daily, spending 2 hours. Quality beats quantity, understanding why approaches work matters more than solution count\n\n# The Resource\n\nFor those interested, we maintain a live database at [LeetWho.com](http://LeetWho.com) where we track actual Google coding interview questions as they're reported. It shows which problems appear in which rounds, when they were last asked, and what approaches work best. Gets updated weekly with new interview reports. The patterns become really clear when you see the actual frequency data.\n\nThe database includes solution patterns, time complexities Google accepts, and common follow-ups for each problem. Seeing \"\\[200\\] Islands follow-up: count distinct islands\" appearing in 23% of cases helps you prepare for the actual interview flow.",

It just made me wonder, the questions for L4 and above are no joke and requires serious preparation. The follow up question really grills the candidate and evaluates their depth of understanding. That\u2019s quite high merit tbh.

    "raw": "Amazon Interview Experience\n\nHey everyone, \nI wanted to share my recent Amazon SDE 2 interview experience.\n\nOnline Assessment\nThe OA wasn't your typical LeetCode style. The two questions were focused on Amazon warehouse problems, so they were very practical and scenario-based.\n\nInterview Rounds\nRound 1: The interview began with a deep dive into Amazon's Leadership Principles. Be prepared with specific examples from your past projects. After that, we moved on to two coding problems.\n * Problem 1: Find the maximum number of meeting rooms required.\n * Problem 2: A variation of the classic House Robber dynamic programming problem with some follow-up questions.\nI was able to solve both problems and felt confident in my answers for the LPs. This round went well, and I was immediately moved to the next one.\n\nRound 2: This round also started with coding.\n * Problem 1: The Find the Celebrity problem.\n * Problem 2: The Sum of Distances in Tree problem.\nI solved both of these as well. The interviewer then asked several LP questions and follow-ups. Again, I felt good about my performance.\n\nRound 3 (System Design): For this round, I was asked to design BookMyShow. I found that preparing from resources like HelloInterview was really helpful for this. The round concluded with more questions about the Leadership Principles.\n\nRound 4 (Bar Raiser): This was a comprehensive round. The interviewer started with Leadership Principles and then dug deep into my previous projects, asking a lot of behavioral questions. After that, we moved on to a Low-Level Design (LLD) problem: designing a car rental system.

    "raw": "Google software engineer 2 |bad interview experience\n\nRecently, I interviewed with Google. Back in April, a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, and after a few days of preparation, I had my first phone screen in May. That went well, and I received positive feedback, with the recruiter encouraging me to prepare for further rounds.\n\nHowever, a few days later I was told the role was on hold until at least July. Naturally, I was disappointed and stopped preparing actively.\n\nThis month, a new recruiter re-connected with me for an opportunity on the Google Cloud team. He scheduled an intro call with a tech lead, but unfortunately, the call got rescheduled multiple times as the tech lead couldn\u2019t join. Eventually, the recruiter asked if I\u2019d be open to proceeding with the four standard interviews (3 DSA + 1 Googliness) before that intro call, which I agreed to.\n\nHere\u2019s how I felt the interviews went:\n\nRound 1 (DSA \u2013 Trees): Didn\u2019t go well.\n\nRound 2 (DSA \u2013 Strings): Okay overall, but I made some assumptions the interviewer wanted differently.\n\nRound 3 (Googliness): I think it went fine.\n\nRound 4 (DSA \u2013 Strings): This round went well.\n\n\nIt\u2019s been about 10 days since I completed the process. I\u2019ve reached out to the recruiter for feedback but haven\u2019t heard back yet. I\u2019m uncertain about the outcome, though I\u2019m still holding onto a bit of hope.\n\nHas anyone else faced something similar in their Google interview process?

I passed the phonescreen and my final round of interviews .... but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be rejected.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of my experience:\n\n# 1. Form Submission:\n\ngot the OA almost 2 week after.\n\n# 2. Online Assessment (OA):\n\nThe format was similar to the regular Amazon OA with:\n\n* 2 DSA problems, mid-hard / hard, first one was using DP. first question fully solved passing every test and second q. just passing some tests.\n* I completed the behavioral section\n\n# 3. Phonescreen:\n\nDSA question + System Design:\n\n* **Question 1:**\u00a0mid level question \n* **Question 2:** system design part\u00a0\n* **Verdict:**\u00a0Cleared\n\n# 4. final round:\n\n* **1 round:**\u00a0\n   * LP's\n   * Coding: I gave a poor solution only handling the most obvious cases, Im pretty sure I failed this part.\n* **2 round:**\n   * LPs: tough conversation, interviewer had unusual english and he was constantly stopping me and asking to repeat or slow down\n   * Coding: interviewer couldn't clearly explain his own problem and even worse he passed the questions on the editor and added new requirements just by talking. Most of the time was spent just understanding the problem.\n* **3 round:**\n   * **LPs**\n   * Coding: explained everything, interviewer seemed happy.\n* **4 round:**\u00a0\n   * LPs\n   * System Design\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nVery disappointed after the final round. They don\u2019t provide feedback. I feel terrible about my bad luck ...  I prepared so hard, practicing multiple medium and hard problems only to get an unfamiliar question in round 1. I mean, what\u2019s the probability? 1 out of 50? 100? daamn. Not mentioning the 3 round, something was telling me to reschedule this final round ...

I\u2019m a CS major and wanted to get experience in software engineering, so I took an internship at a small finance company. The issue is, they don\u2019t really have any tech people or mentors \u2014 they just handed me a project and told me to build a full web app (frontend and backend) from scratch. I don\u2019t have much experience, so I\u2019ve been relying a lot on AI to help me get through most of it.\n\nMy boss knew from the start that I only had very basic experience, but I don\u2019t think she fully understands how difficult it is to actually build and launch a full MVP app \u2014 especially as a solo intern. She keeps throwing new feature ideas at me, expecting me to build both the frontend and backend, and it\u2019s honestly overwhelming.\n\nI\u2019ve been using AI to help me get through most of it \u2014 I understand the code and I do have to edit it and debug it a lot of times to work (so I do get the gist of things) and can explain what it\u2019s doing, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to write a lot of it from scratch without help. Because the expectation is to deliver a working product, I haven\u2019t really had the time or space to sit down and actually learn things deeply \u2014 it\u2019s all about output right now.\n\nI\u2019m a rising sophomore, and I\u2019m worried about how to talk about this experience when applying to future internships. On paper, I can say I helped build an app, but in reality, AI played a huge role. I just feel kind of like a fraud, even though I\u2019ve been trying my best for my context, and I really do want to learn.\n\nAlso \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s going to ask me to keep working during the school year to keep maintaining or expanding the app. Based on how things have gone so far, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea. It feels like the workload will just keep growing, and since she doesn\u2019t have experience in tech, it\u2019s hard for her to gauge what\u2019s realistic, and I'll just be stuck in this cycle of never learning things properly.\n\nWould love any advice, especially if you've been in a similar spot, on how I should approach future applications and internships and what to say for my interviews etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

If AI isn\u2019t something your company uses, obviously don't say you've chatted a lot of it, but you could still bring it up when she assigns new tasks and just be upfront saying I'm not sure how to approach it, do you have any resources or someone in the company I could turn to if I have questions. \n2. **In interviews**: For future internships, don\u2019t be hard on yourself for using AI, especially in today\u2019s job market where AI is\u00a0*everywhere* and it's *so difficult* to get an interview or job. Do not diminish the work you did by saying AI did a lot of it. And yeah, the only potential downside is if you\u2019re asked to explain things in a more technical interview setting where you might need to go deeper.

    "raw": "Does having one SWE internship make getting future internships easier?\n\nRising 3rd year, just finished my first SWE internship at a pretty-big-deal startup. According to my boss and all my coworkers, I made an impressive impact while I was there, and I just loved the experience overall!\n\nBut as fall is coming around, I'm extra nervous about tech recruiting for next summer. I got my first internship through a lot of networking and a behavioral interview, nothing technical beyond the projects / experiences on my resume. I want to try aiming for Big Tech or a bigger company (though I wouldn't be opposed to interning at another startup either), and it feels like I'm facing a boss fight.\n\nHow do I know if my experience is \"enough\" for these roles compared to other candidates? I'm proud of what I did at the startup, but all my fellow CS majors have way more impressive sounding internship descriptions than me. Technical interviews sound extremely terrifying (like I have to code on the spot while someone watches me??). I also transferred into the CS major a bit late and I'm often insecure about being \"behind.\"\n\nI'm paranoid that my first internship was a fluke, and I'll never get an opportunity like that again. Are recruiters more likely to consider your resume if you've had a prior SWE internship on there? \n\nAny encouragement or advice would help a lot! Aside from just grinding LeetCode and maybe another personal project, I'm not really sure what to do. :((",

I thought I'd give back and share my interview experience with Microsoft.\n\n**1st interview**: 20 mintues of behavioral questions. Leetcode easy that I was able to solve very quickly and pass all test cases. Also built great rapport with the interviewer.\n\n**2nd interview**: 20 mintues of behavioral questions. Leetcode medium with a tree. The interviewer slightly rushed me and wanted me to start coding right away. We got to testing the code but I found some errors in my tracing of the recursion and fell short on time. \n\n**3rd interview**: 20 mintues of behavioral questions. Leetcode medium involving backtracking. I solved it first try and passed all test cases. The interviewer also wanted to move onto system design, but time ran short at the end with only \\~5 minutes, so we were able to discuss only on a high level.\n\n**Result**: To my surprise, I got rejected \\~2 hours later. I thought I still had a strong shot, since I thought that my performances in the 1st and 3rd interviews would offset my performance in the 2nd one a bit.\n\nIt seems like Microsoft places a heavy emphasis on behavioral questions, which were the first half of all interviews. That leaves 20-25 minutes for the coding, which may seen tight. Thus, regular practice is key.\n\nFor my 3rd round, I'm surprised my interviewer had planned behavioral, coding, and system design ALL in one interview.\n\nAlso, Microsoft doesn't offer interview feedback.\n\nFeel free to comment below if you have any questions and best to luck with all on their interviews!",

I had one follow up email from the recruiter asking how it went the following business day and then never heard anything and it's been almost a month. \n\nWhat's a bit odd is that I was never asked to fill out a formal application, I just provided a resume and was told that JS wanted to interview me. I was contacted by someone from JS asking me to fill out a simple questionnaire (e.g. regarding visa status etc), so I assume I am in their system somewhere...\n\n Just curious is anyone else had a similar experience. Is JS known for ghosting? My hunch is that these third party recruiters mass recruit/set up tons of initial interviews such that there isn't time to process anyone who isn't an immediate \"yes\" and send a formal \"after careful consideration, we will not be moving forward...\" email.

I don't think it's good to be dependent on AI since you'll be the most replaceable, especially in a field like frontend development.

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta\u2019s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn\u2019t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn\u2019t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don\u2019t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said \u201cyou are exactly what Meta is looking for\u201d so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta\u2019s EM full loop (haven\u2019t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I\u2019ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I\u2019ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I\u2019ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn\u2019t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don\u2019t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it\u2019s api. Don\u2019t think I did that good there \ud83d\ude15, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Meta Code Screen \u2013\u00a0Passed!\n\nJust passed my first ever \"serious\" technical code screen with Leetcode-style problems. (I'd passed \"practical\" code screens that mostly tested general Python ability, but I'd never passed one where the bar was this high.) I figured I would share my experience.\n\nFirst, let me say that I won't give away the questions, but they were both in the top 50 tagged questions on Leetcode, no special variants whatsoever. I think officially one was listed as \"medium\" and the other as \"hard\", but both were on the easier end of those categories, and the \"medium\" one in particular is really an easy if you know the solution. The medium involved an array and a greedy solution and the \"hard\" (again, debatable) involved BFS / DFS on a grid. Not too bad. \n\nWhat went well for me was that I was very clear in explaining my thought process *before* I started coding. I wrote a commented-out high-level outline in the editor, asked my interviewer if this sounded like a good plan, and they agreed. Also, and this is important, I made sure to ask about empty input or any special cases, which they really liked. After the first problem I was asked to walk through an example to check correctness and I did.   \n  \nThe second problem (the DFS / BFS one) proceeded similarly: I outlined the solution, got buy-in, then implemented. In this case I forgot to ask about empty input (I didn't think the grid could be empty) but they asked me at the end how to handle that. I also missed incrementing a variable at one point and they mentioned that I had \"missed something\", but I was quick to identify it and thanked them for pointing it out, which probably helped my case.\n\nOnce it was over they asked me if I had any questions for them and I asked them about their projects and if overall they were happy with the work at Meta, and we had a nice little chat around that for a few minutes. I left feeling good.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience! Hope it helps! Now I have to pass the onsite... ",

    "raw": "Interview Journey with Glean, Uber, etc For L5/Senior Roles\n\nHey, I am a Software Engineer based out of India with 5 YoE. I was helped immensely by a few of the online communities for my interview prep, so here\u2019s something from my side to give back. I\u2019ll briefly introduce myself, then go over two sections: the prep and the interviews (with their offer numbers, if offered). Gear up for a long (and hopefully helpful) post.\n\nSo a quick intro: I am a CS grad from a Tier-1 Indian college. I had been working at Google for around the past 3 years. I was an L4 and there were a few reasons I decided to leave (in no particular order):\n\n- Lack of good projects to get a promo. This was partly my fault and partly because there were too many L4s in my team.\n- My comp for 2025 was actually lower than 2024 due to front loaded stocks at the time of joining.\n- I was nearing 5 YoE which is good enough to get an L5 (or equivalent role) in most companies, so I decided I\u2019ll leave Google if I get an L5 position at a company of my choice rather than waiting a year or so for the L5 promo at Google itself.\n\nCurrent TC:\n\n- Base: 41L\n- Yearly bonus: 8L\n- Stocks (to be vested in 2025): 30-35L (depending on where the stock is)\n- Total: 80-85L\n\n# The Prep\n\nI prepared for a total of 2-3 months with an average of 2-3 hours of daily studies/practice. According to my experience, there were a total of 4 kinds of rounds that companies ask (with some exceptions like Stripe). I\u2019ll go over each one of them in the order of the time I invested for them.\n\n## System Design\n\nI spent the most amount of time on System Design prep. Partly because I thought for an L5, this should be the most important round and also because working at Google comes with the disadvantage that you\u2019re cut off from the key technologies so much that you\u2019ve to learn about them from scratch (although there are a lot of similar things in Google but there are quite a few differences too) and also because there\u2019s so much to learn too. \n\nI will list down the resources I studied from and roughly in which order, but keep in mind that everyone will have a different requirement and might need more basic learning first or could skip some of the basic stuff too.\n\n1. Designing Data-Intensive Application Book: This is a classic textbook that I\u2019d say one should read even if they\u2019re not preparing for interviews, but especially if they are. It goes into the details of how databases work internally among other things. This is a great book for building fundamentals of the System Design.\n2. System Design Interview (Vol 1) by Alex Xu: This is a very beginner friendly book and explains terms like consistent hashing, CAP theorem, etc while solving some of the easier System design problems.\n3. Hello Interview website: This I\u2019d say is the most important resource among all. Mainly because of the practice section in it. The practice sections have a bunch of questions (each with a solution written for it and most have videos too of solutions), where each question is split into multiple sub-questions that you\u2019ve to answer one-by-one on which you get AI generated feedback. You\u2019ve to buy a premium for this practice section, but I think it\u2019s totally worth it. They also have reading material on the website which is quite helpful and is free.\n4. System Design Interview (Vol 2) by Alex Xu: In contrast to the first volume of the book, this goes into a lot of details of every problem, maybe sometimes more than what\u2019d be needed for an interview and could be overwhelming, so only come to this when you\u2019ve a good understanding of things. I only read a few chapters from this book. \n5. Some other resources that I considered and went through partly are:\n    1. \u2018Jordan has no life\u2019 channel\u2019s Youtube playlists.\n    2. Some of Gaurav Sen\u2019s YouTube videos.\n\nA few extra pointers that I\u2019d like to give are:\n\n- Take good notes that you can go through again and again.\n- List down every topic that you want to prepare for (like reading SQL vs NoSQL, internals of Redis, etc) and make sure you check them all.\n- Follow a pattern/path during interviews. I followed the one that HelloInterview suggests: Listing function and non-functional requirements first, then core entities and rough API contract too. Then proceed to a HLD design with a basic structure handling all function requirements and then proceed to identify bottlenecks (non-functional reqs helps here) and solve them.\n\n## DSA\n\nThis I\u2019d say most people are familiar with on how to prepare for. My plan was to solve top company tagged questions for the companies I was preparing for (this requires premium though). With this, there\u2019s a good chance that you will get a few DSA questions in your interviews that you\u2019ve already solved. \n\nMake sure you\u2019ve gone through all the main topics too, like DP, graphs, two pointers, stack, binary search, etc.\n\n## LLD/Machine Coding\n\nI would say there\u2019s a lack of very good resources for preparing for LLD rounds even though they are becoming increasingly important with time (as focus on DSA reduces). I\u2019d break down the types of questions asked in LLD in 2 categories:\n\n1. Focused on implementation heavy DSA questions. These are questions like implement LRU cache, LC 432, etc.\n2. Focused on design principles. Learn design principles like SOLID, Strategy, Observer, Factory, Singleton, etc. Although I feel Big Tech (and good startups) don\u2019t focus much on this, I could be wrong.\n\nThe focus of this round is to give working code quickly, and most optimal algorithm might not be needed always. There\u2019s also emphasis on having good class structure with SOLID principles, code modularity, good variable naming, etc.\n\nOne resource I found helpful was awesome-low-level-design repo on github by ashishps1 which has solutions for a few famous problems in multiple languages. Christopher Okhravi's Design patterns playlist on YT is also good to learn design patterns (especially the first 6 videos).\n\nChoosing a language here is very important, as most people are familiar in Java OOPS but in C++ STL. For DSA, C++ STL is enough and OOPS is not needed, but LLD rounds require both. I chose Java because C++ requires memory management (there\u2019s smart pointers but I didn\u2019t want to get into that) so I had to learn Java equivalents for C++ STL and practice for it.\n\nWhile speed is important for every round, it is the most critical for these LLD rounds as companies want candidates who can give working code quickly.\n\n## Hiring Manager/Past Work\n\nThere are mainly two kinds areas of discussion here:\n\n- Your past work experience where the interviewer who is mostly the hiring manager goes into the details of your past projects (1 or 2). Make sure you choose a few projects (maybe just one project if it\u2019s enough) that showcases your technical prowess in which you had to take some design decisions weighing the alternatives, maybe had junior engineers working with you (if you\u2019re going for a Senior role) and worked with different stakeholders.\n    - To prepare for this, I did a mock round from Hello Interview (it\u2019s expensive but the interviewer was very helpful and gave a few good pointers). Mock interviews are helpful in general, but more so for this round is what I feel.\n    - Make sure you have a diagram handy of the project you\u2019re going to discuss here, maybe on Lucidchart.\n- General behavioral questions that I don\u2019t think I need to go in detail here.\n\n# The Interviews\n\nA few pointers here before I proceed on my interview experiences:\n\n- List out the companies who want to go for and categorize them into \u201cdream\u201d and \u201ctarget\u201d. Once you\u2019ve done some basic level of prep, you can start applying to the \u201ctarget\u201d companies while maybe tailoring your prep slightly to the company for which you\u2019ve upcoming interviews (as sometimes these companies have slightly different procedures). It\u2019s okay to be rejected from these companies, but important to gain experience and confidence from these rounds before starting to apply for \u201cdream\u201d companies.\n- Try to have competing offers in hand which can easily help you negotiate your salary by 10-20%. It\u2019s a very important bargaining chip.\n\nI had the following list of dream companies:\n\n- Uber\n- Glean (an enterprise search software company)\n- Databricks\n- Stripe\n\nDatabricks generally needs more YoE for a Senior role and Stripe has a very unconventional interview procedure (debugging and API integrations rounds), so I thought of applying to Uber and Glean first and then going for the Databricks and Stripe if I don\u2019t get into any one of the first two.\n\nAnd to practice I chose following companies:\n\n- Coinbase\n- Linkedin\n\n## Coinbase (IC5)\n\nI applied through their portal here. Their turnaround time was very quick and interviews were also scheduled very quickly.\n\n**OA round:** They had a DSA/implementation heavy round for OA. Clean code was not needed, only passing their tests was. Make sure you\u2019re very quick with using sets, maps, etc. \n\nI passed the OA round and next up, three rounds were scheduled for main interview.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked to design a stockbroker for crypto. Went well I think but there were a few hiccups when I said I\u2019d use Redis sorted sets to solve for something.\n\n**Tech Execution:** This was an LLD round only that I honestly fumbled because I wasn\u2019t quick enough because of my lack of speed in using Java collections. Otherwise the round was not tough, just needed very quick implementations for the many parts there were to the problem.\n\n**Domain:** Again an LLD round which I was more prepared for after messing up the previous one and I think I did really well in this one.\n\n**Verdict:** Ghosted which I can assume meant No hire. In retrospect, I applied for this without any LLD prep (and then didn\u2019t prepare much either for it). But it was okay as I didn\u2019t want to go to Coinbase anyway and it was a good learning experience.\n\n## Linkedin (IC3)\n\nI applied via Linkedin only for this and again their turnaround time was very quick.\n\n**Screening round:** There was a LC medium and some CS basics questions. Went very well.\n\nI passed the screening round and then there were 4 rounds scheduled:\n\n**DSA 1 & 2:** Couple of LC medium questions in both. Were simple enough (and I actually had seen 1-2 of them on LC while practicing) and both rounds went well.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a slight modification of the famous \u2018top-K articles/videos shared\u2019 question. This round didn\u2019t go very well partly because I wasn\u2019t well prepared. The interviewer was also not very receptive to my points at times.\n\n**Past work/HM:** Mainly the round was focused on past complex projects I had worked on, of my choosing. Interviewer asked a few questions here and there on my choices. This round went quite well.\n\nRecruiter reached out to me saying that they want to take a repeat of System design round as it didn\u2019t go well, but in office. I agreed, but stalled for 2-3 weeks because my Glean and Uber rounds had started, and also because I wanted some competing offer for Glean/Uber.\n\n**System Design Part 2:** Interviewer wanted to discuss my team\u2019s overall architecture for first half which went quite well and second half was for a quick system design question which went well I\u2019d say.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. \n\n**TC:** Initially they had said they can give a max of 95L-1Cr for a Senior role, but by this time I already had the Glean offer so they were willing to go up to 1.15 Cr but I declined. This TC includes all the components (base they were offering was 65L).\n\n## Glean (Lead/Senior role)\n\nThis was the main company I was preparing for, mostly because of the future share value potential and amazing talent density. I was lucky that the recruiter only reached out to me at the right time. I only replied when I was confident with my prep though.\n\n**HM round:** A brief 30 mins round for intros and about what I\u2019ve worked on in the past. Don\u2019t think this was supposed to be a hire/no-hire decision round.\n\nThere were a total of 4 rounds after that:\n\n**DSA 1&2:** Both rounds had LC medium-hard questions with a hard followup. There was a good discussion in both and interviewers were quite receptive of my ideas. In one of the rounds, my solution was optimal but would have led to a lengthy implementation so there the interviewer suggested a slightly different approach which I hoped on quickly. Both the rounds went quite well but I felt they could\u2019ve been slightly better due to different reasons.\n\n**Past Work:** I was well prepared for this with diagrams handy to explain quickly. Round was supposed to last for 60 mins but interviewer was happy with me and the round ended in 45 mins with last 5-10 mins going into \u2018Why leave Google\u2019 kind of questions.\n\n**LLD round:** This was a 120 min round that I was honestly a little nervous about because I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but it was a typical implementation round just with more parts to it. I wrote good modular code with SOLID principles (especially the S part of it). Any other design principles were not needed but I needed to be quick and was able to complete all the parts. I did later notice after the round that in the last sub-part I had not handled one case (because I had not read the question properly), but not sure if the interviewer noticed that.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. They did not let me negotiate as I didn\u2019t have any competing offers at the time (Linkedin was there but they were giving lesser comp so that didn\u2019t matter), and also because they strongly felt that the comp they were offering was quite good. \n\n**TC:** 65 base and 5000 RSUs (not ESOPs) to be vested equally in 4 years. Their share value according to the last funding round is around 50$, so that means around 55L per year, bringing total comp to around 1.2 Cr (they don\u2019t have any bonuses).\n\n## Uber (L5)\n\nRecruiter had reached out to me. I replied back when I was confident with my prep.\n\n**Screening:** A DSA question of LC medium difficulty that I was able to answer quickly and then some discussion happened about my past work.\n\nI passed the screening and there were 4 rounds scheduled after that:\n\n**DSA:** I didn\u2019t find the interviewer very good for this round. The first two questions he gave me were known to me which I told him (not sure why XD, as I\u2019ve not done that in the past). He gave a different question after that which he maybe wasn\u2019t prepared for as there were a lot of edge cases in it (especially in the followup) and I guess the question was new to him too. I solved the main part quickly but didn\u2019t get a lot of time for the followup\u2019s edge cases but I did give some hand-wavy solution. A lot of time was wasted in this round in the beginning in changing the questions and interviewer had a meeting after that so he didn\u2019t extend the interview.\n\n**LLD:** Interview asked me a LC medium DSA question only for this which I was able to solve quickly and we had some chat about my past work after that.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a Ad click aggregator similar question. Interview went above average, not the best but I felt it was passable.\n\n**Past Work/HM:** This was a 90 mins round. First 50 mins went into a past project discussion which I felt went well but not sure if the interviewer felt the same. Next 40 mins went into behavioral questions which I felt went good but then at the end interviewer asked me why am I not waiting to become L5 at Google before looking for L5 opportunity elsewhere (which I felt was a stupid question because why not?), I said I feel I\u2019m L5 ready but won\u2019t become L5 for a year more in Google. We had a bunch of to and fro on that where I felt she was not very happy with some of my answers.\n\n**Verdict:** Recruiter told me that they want to take a repeat of the HM round, but as I had already gotten the Glean offer and that being my first preference I declined.\n\nSo yeah, joining Glean now! Feel free to ask questions and I\u2019d love to answer as many as I can. But please don\u2019t ask the specific questions that were asked in the interviews to me.",

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who\u2019ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n\u201cDesign an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.\u201d\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t\u2022\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t\u2022\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think \u201cmore from a customer perspective.\u201d That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on \u201cauthentication\u201d (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn\u2019t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn\u2019t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t\u2022\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t\u2022\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t\u2022\tSaving payment details\n\n\t\u2022\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an \u201cauthentication system\u201d? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn\u2019t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I need advice:\n\n\t\u2022\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t\u2022\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from \u201cauthentication\u201d \u2192 \u201centire payment subsystem\u201d), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t\u2022\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f",

I was able to cover some cases but not a working solution.\n\nResult: (Signal not clear, follow-up interview needed)\n\nScreening 2)\n\n1) LCA of two nodes III (I interrupted the interviewer and had told her that I had already seen this question).\n\nAt this point, the interviewer gave me 5 extra minutes and apologized.\n\n2) Minimum add to make valid parentheses.\n\nHere I explained we just need to count how many open parenths we need to add if there are too many closing, and the number of closing we need to add if there are too many open, and add those two counts together. Proceeded with the solution after I got the okay.\n\n3) Basic calculator II. Follow up: can you do O(1) extra space?\n\nHere I used a stack but took a little longer for me because Im very weak with edge cases. Second approach I used two variables for simulating a stack.\n\nResult: pass. \n\nFeedback from what recruiter told me:\n\nThe good: \n\nMy communication skills were very high, so the interviewers liked that and decided to give me a chance despite failing first screening.\n\nThe bad: \n\nYou need to be faster at finding the solution.

(USA role)\n\nContext: Started working as a SWE at a big bank after graduation, but kept sporadically applying to new grad roles because I feel like my current role was limiting (aging tech) and I wanted more growth even at the cost of risk.\n\nApplied: Mid-May of 2025.\n\nOA: Took it early-mid June.\n\nA three interview loop was scheduled and taken this Monday.\n\nInterview 1: Probably bar raiser. 3 LP questions, each with a deep dive. This round I felt 50/50 on; I think my first answer came off as too esoteric and not very clear because I wanted to discuss a highly technical project I finished in school but perhaps some of it went over the interviewers head due to lacking communication on my end. Rest of the stories I answered with experiences building projects at my internship, and I felt like I smashed those pretty well. Though results speak otherwise...\n\nInterview 2: Two LPs, and an LC medium with followup. LPs were pretty easy, I focused on previous work experience again which I felt worked better than my school stories. LC I solved with some but not too many hints in optimal time, got the followup in optimal time as well. Probably smoothest round.\n\nInterview 3: 2 LCs. First one was a very common interview question that Amazon asks, solved it optimally and got good feedback from interviewer. I lowkey dropped the ball on the 2nd LC, wasn't actually that hard. It was a tree Q, thinking back should have been a slam-dunk but waffled because I wasn't exactly sure what the problem at hand was and the interviewer had explained it in a way that was not very intuitive (understandable to not give away answer). Eeked out an optimal solution with explanation of time complexity. Looking back, I probably missed a positive data point because I wasn't able to move onto a 3rd LC.\n\nVerdict: Rejected today, 4 business days later. Really hard to hear, my dream is to relocate to west coast. But life goes as it will.",

Currently at 158k CAD TC. My current company is going 4 day RTO in September and I didn't have much interest in doing that. I started applying for new jobs the day it was announced internally (June 6th).\n\nPrep:  \nSpent about 4 hours a day on leetcode working exclusively on neetcode 150. Solved about 120 of them or so (avoided binary/bit manipulation and premium only questions for the most part). Studied system design in a hurry/hello interview as well. Did this starting the same day I started applying for jobs right up till my on site interview rounds (somewhere between 1-2 months).\n\nJob search:  \nFocused on applying to about 5-10 high quality jobs per day at the beginning (mostly only applying for positions with disclosed pay with about a 20-30% raise from my current comp). \n\nI heard back from 7/70 companies I applied for in total (10% rate). After less than 2 weeks of this I had too many recruiter calls/initial interviews scheduled that I stopped applying to new positions. \n\nOf all the recruiter calls I only failed to make it past one where it turned out from the salary \"range\" listed for the role they were only paying the absolute bottom so the job was not a good match for me anyways. Some companies started with a online assessment but I found these to be quite rare when applying for senior positions. \n\nOf all the companies that I proceeded to initial interviews with I was invited to take a final on site round with 3. Of these 3 I received offers from 2 and the other one told me my results were good but the position got filled already.\n\nResult:  \nGot 2 offers. One was fully remote but a bit of a low ball. 150k all cash, no equity or bonus, but fully remote. Declined this offer.\n\nSecond offer was with a late stage startup. 375k CAD TC (of which about 200 is cash), 2x per week in office. Basically a better offer than I imagined was even possible in Toronto. Accepted this offer and will be starting next month.\n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone may have!\n\n",

Then we headed into the LLD which felt extremely straight forward and simple only having to implement one class and two methods, but I was super slow and I started off not saying much and towards the end of the time he pointed out some things that could raise potential errors which I promptly fixed. Finished implementing with only a few minutes left and he emphasized wanting to ask a follow up, which I answered, and then last minute asked if I had any questions for him. Didn't feel very confident with this one because I think the question was meant to be simple with a lot of follow ups to implement if I was better and more efficient. (6/10)\n* Round 2:  Bar Raiser - Asked 3 LP questions with follow ups in this round for 30 minutes, which I feel like overall went well except one part where he a specific semi-technical question about webhooks which I kind of blanked on because the project was a while ago, and he just said it was ok and moved on to the next question. This part by far I felt the worst about, and kind of lost confidence when asked about how I felt about my impact and the preparation I took to learn how to develop an API. Last 30 minutes he let me ask him questions. (5/10\n* Round 3: Non tagged LC Question - This by far I felt was my best round, but only because I won the lottery with the question it felt really simple even though I had never seen it before. I learned from my LLD round to start talking through my thoughts, so I started by describing between 2 approaches I'd use and describing their time complexity. After explaining why the 2nd would be better, interviewer said to go ahead and implement and I explained my thinking throughout. Solution was valid, but interviewer asked if it could further be optimized. Went through two more optimizations, the 2nd one being the most optimal and he gave me a slight hint on but it was not an easily apparent one so I felt ok with the small hint. I was taking some time to implement the search algorithm, but he seemed like he was satisfied because he said it was ok since the logic was all there, and with the last 25 minutes he let me ask him questions. (7/10)\n\nOverall not confident at all about my chances, especially with the mentions of a hiring freeze, but I thought the whole process and experience was amazing and my interviewers were extremely kind. I wish I had just been better prepared for the behavioral parts, overpreparation on the technical may have caused me my issues on freezing up and not being super prepared on my stories about my technical experience and learning process.",

    "raw": "My Amazon SDE I interview experience\n\nHi community, I would like share my interview loop experience.\n\n1st round:\nTwo coding questions were asked in this round. The first question was related to implementation of BFS. I did well with clear communication of my thought process. The question required to find shortest path and I have chosen BFS implementation. \n\nIn the later half I was asked a gaming question. There were deck of cards which were 30 in total. Each player can pick 3 cards. Each card can have numbers between 0 to 9 and color among Blue,Red, Yellow. \n\nWinner will be decided on the following conditions:\nPlayer picking all three same color given high priority. Player with same number given second priority. Player with two cards of same color or number and one different card can be considered as third high priority. If there is tie among players and the process of picking cards repeats. I was asked to write LLD. Since I felt it was length to write all the methods, interviewer asked me to declare methods required and just to write comments what each methods was used for and I did the same. \n\n2nd round:\nFirst 30 mins behavioral, I was asked 2 standard Amazon LP questions.\n1) Outside comfort area.\n2) Faced obstacle and don't know how to proceed \n\nIn the second half I was asked to implementation of pizza ordering. Again it was LLD implementation.\nInterviewer did not give any inputs he wanted me to do it even defining the requirements. I selected three requirements to define pizza type ( size, crust, toppings) and I implemented enum for each one of the specification. Interviewer wanted me to write constructors, getter and setters. Then he wanted me to implement ordering and calculating prize of pizza.There was some redundancy in the code implementation but Interviewer gave hints to optimization of the code. I did some changes like implemented interface. I almost finished code but I felt it could written little better.\n\n3rd round:\nComplete behavioral round. This is supposed to be 1 hour round lasted only 35 mins. I was asked around 3 to 4 questions. I was disappointed because I felt I didn't answer the questions as expected. I am not sure why interview was ended earlier. Is it because interviewer did not find enough content to extend or got enough information to close down the interview? I was a bit crisp in answering.\n\nIs it a bad sign or red flag if 1 hr behavioral round was completed in 30 to 35 mins?\n\nNote: Awaiting for result",

    "raw": "Feeling stuck after joining Cisco as an apprentice instead of a software engineer \u2014 Need advice\n\n\nHi everyone,\nI'm a 2024 CSE graduate from a tier-3 college. For the past year, I've been actively applying for software engineering roles. I\u2019m confident with DSA/LeetCode and can solve problems comfortably. The biggest challenge for me has been the lack of internship experience.\n\nI heard many people saying referrals from top product-based companies (PBCs) help get interviews, even for fresh grads without internships. So I tried reaching out to employees and got referrals for new grad roles at places like PayPal, ServiceNow, Salesforce, SAP Labs, Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Adobe, and Flipkart and lot more companies. Sadly, I didn\u2019t get a single interview call.\n\nThe only calls I got were from small startups, often with bonds and low pay which exploit freshers. After so much disappointment, I recently joined Cisco , not as a software engineer, but as a Technical Graduate Apprentice. Everyone around me says Cisco is a great brand to have on my resume, but I feel disheartened.\n\nAs an apprentice, Cisco pays only \u20b938k per month, and I\u2019m expected to work for 1 full year. If I leave early (e.g., after 6 months), they won\u2019t give me any experience certificate , not even a generic one. What hurts more is knowing Cisco interns are paid \u20b91 lakh per month, and SDEs obviously earn even more. Why is there such a huge pay disparity when I'm doing real work here too?\n\nI feel like I\u2019m stuck in a low paying role with little growth, and the pay is on par (or even less) than some service-based companies' digital roles (like TCS Digital/Prime, Infosys Specialist Programmer, etc.).

First, no company knows wtf they actually want, so we struggle just to land interviews. After 7 months of grinding applications, I realized I wasn't interview-ready and needed to brush up. But where to even start? DSA? ML fundamentals? Deep learning? Transformer architecture? LLM fine-tuning? RAGs? Vector databases? SQL? MLOps? The new agentic AI everyone's hyping??\n\nI've studied ALL of it and still have zero clue what I'll be asked. Then I learn this MBB-adjacent tech consulting firm uses CASE INTERVIEWS. Are you kidding me?  \nI was already burnt out and couldn't bring myself to prep properly. Still went through with it - interviewer was nice but I absolutely tanked it. Could identify the business problem but completely blanked on ML solutions. She pivoted to fundamentals when she saw me drowning, but classical ML is so rare nowadays I was rusty AF.\n\nWent in with zero expectations since I knew I didn't prep, figured it'd be practice. But now that it's over, I feel completely burnt out. That fire that made me quit my job 3 years ago to pivot into data science? Gone. All I have is a sore ass from trying to straddle multiple boats while desperately keeping up with this field. The interviewer mentioned she got mentored when she joined many years ago - must be nice! What early-career person knows how to nail technical case interviews end-to-end?\n\n*I'm not cut out for this.

This round was fully behavioral and it was about 4 leadership principles, questions and followups on my answers, the interviewer was a really experienced manager who twisted the questions a lot, like for disagree and commit, he wanted a time when I disagreed with my team and follow up on when my team disagreed with me and I had to go with my team's decision. rest was earn trust, Dive Deep etc. I think the round went really well, answered all of them and we had a common point of interest in ml topic where he has a paper on it and I have a project on it. Overall felt like 8/10 or 9/10. Clarified that the hiring was also not for his team or has no idea about team matching.\n\nRound 2 - Coding - interviewer was a SDE 2, first one was a Binary tree, pretty easy, solved it and its followups, explained the DS I would use and coded it, second was a bit difficult, (DM for the particular questions) was able to solve it and answered few follow ups on optimization, last follow up was really hard and could only answer it partially. overall felt like a 7/10.\n\nRound 3 - 1 lp plus coding, best round I would say, another experienced manager, connected really well, conversation was amazing, mentioned that there would no lld or that this is not a LLD problem, coding problem was relatively easy, he said he was mainly looking at the maintainability and etc of the code, he was happy with my solution and answers for followups and end was also good. Told me about a timeline SDE 1's have for adaption etc. overall 9/10 or 10/10. \n\nWhat do you guys think about my chances are? interviewer 2 and 3 share the same location too? would that have anything to do my hiring location?\n\nUpdate!!: I got an inclined to hire to offer, waitlisted.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer \u2014 my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere \u2014 \u201cbusiness decision\u201d. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn\u2019t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn\u2019t believe in myself \u2014 and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I\u2019d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn\u2019t working. My mindset wasn\u2019t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach \u2014 the works. I followed every \u201cget hired in tech\u201d thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds \u2014 but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen,\u00a0**Amazon**\u00a0sent me an\u00a0**SDE II L5 OA**\u00a0invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me \u2014 no, the OA destroyed me \u2014 and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I\u2019d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise \u2014 great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they\u2019d rather trust an irrelevant OA\u2019s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round \u2014 for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then\u2026 something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp \u2014 fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking:\u00a0*\u201cThis has to be the one.\u201d*\n\nI made it to the final round \u2014 three back-to-back interviews in a single day.

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you\u2019re going to do something to your resume, let\u2019s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative.\u00a0*Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?*\u00a0Don\u2019t assume they\u2019ll figure it out. They\u2019re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n\u274c Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n\u2705 Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don\u2019t include your GPA if it\u2019s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n\u274c \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n\u2705 \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n\u274c Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n\u2705 \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your \u201cAbout\u201d section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n\u274c No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n\u2705 \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your \u201cAbout\u201d section.\n\n\u274c Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n\u2705 \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n\u274c DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n\u2705 DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 \u2013 Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the \u201cDive Deep\u201d leadership principle. I shared 5\u20136 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don\u2019t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 \u2013 Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2\u20133 minutes\u2014probably nerves\u2014but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I\u2019d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a \u201cgood place\u201d with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 \u2013 LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn\u2019t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern\u2014brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct.

We use prefix sum for this.\n\nThe interviewer was very helpful and kept complimenting my coding methods and approaches.\n\nThe interviewer went for 45 minutes.\n\nTIPS - use camel case, write comments, and even if you don't write the exact correct code, make sure that the interviewer understands and verifies your approach.\n\nROUND 2 -\n\nGiven a vector of strings, where each string is name of player, and any two players with a common letter between them are part of the same team. Find the number of teams\n\nWent with DSU approach, to find number of connect components, treating each player as a node, and connecting whenever we have a common letter between two players.\n\nFirst I went with an unoptimal approach, using DSU for all N players as nodes , which results in TC - N*L*alpha(N) , where L is avg length of string.\n\nThe interviewer pointed towards a N*L*alpha(26) approach, where we combine DSU using the alphabets and I was able to solve it from there.\n\nThe interview was over within 30 minutes.\n\nTIPS - study graphs really well, you don't need to go deep and do stuff like dp on graphs etc. Also, focus on monotonic stacks, prefix sums, and trees. just strengthen your basics, neetcode 250 should be more than enough for google DSA rounds.\n\nRESULT - Accepted\n\nIf you have any doubts AMA !",

Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users\u2014so I\u2019d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1\u20132 = junior, 3\u20134 = mid, 5\u20136 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company\u2019s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well\u20143 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I\u2019d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn\u2019t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I\u2019d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it\u2019s better to start lower so \u201cexpectations wouldn\u2019t be too high,\u201d otherwise I might \u201cget into trouble.\u201d Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way\u2014I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might\u2019ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it\u2019s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I\u2019m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6\u201312 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

I felt good about this round.\n\n**Round 3 (2 LPs + 1 DSA)** \u2013 *7th August (rescheduled)*\n\n* Taken by an SDE2.\n* For the first LP, the interviewer interrupted me midway; I answered the action part but couldn\u2019t get to the result before they jumped to the second LP.\n* In DSA, they stopped me multiple times, asking \u201cWhy this?\u201d or \u201cWhy only this?\u201d while I was coding and explaining. This did break my flow, but I still managed to finish the solution.\n* With 3 minutes left, they asked me to dry run with an example, which I did. Then, they quickly asked two more questions before we wrapped up.\n\nI also made sure to ask 2\u20133 thoughtful questions at the end of each interview.\n\nNow I\u2019m in the waiting phase \u2014 they said they\u2019d get back to me within 5 business days.",

    "raw": "How do you get through the inital months of not feeling ready for OAs?\n\nApologizes if this is a dumb question, but I was wondering how yall got yourselves out of the negative feedback loop of not feeling ready to take on actual technical interviews because you haven't practice enough yet in the beginning of your LC journey. I started my leetcode journey at the beginning of summer, I felt like I would easily get burnt out if I was spending hours studying, so I just consistently do about 20-30 minutes a day, just do one problem a day. I have been following [algomap.io](http://algomap.io) cus I like the way they visualize the answer before coding, I totally feel like a beginner still, I\u2019ve managed to get a couple easy questions done by myself, but majority of the medium questions I could not get the answer at all after 20 minutes. In terms of schooling, I am in my last semester, so I still have time to develop my skills before rushing to get a job. But the reason I asked this question is because I recently got the invitation to do the first round OA for Capitol One. If I am being honest, I know I\u2019m not going to do well based off how I\u2019m doing in LC. I am still going to take it for the experience, but I\u2019m in this constant negative loop where I don\u2019t feel ready to take these OAs, but I need to apply to jobs, I do need a job, I don\u2019t want to wait till I graduate to start applying. That\u2019s why I wanted to ask how do yall get through the initial months of not feeling ready at all? I\u2019ve been trying to slowly increase the amount of studying I need to do, I\u2019ve been slowly started liking LC, but I have a lot of moments where if I am totally lost, I just lose all motivation to even try. So, any advice would be greatly appreciative. Thank you.\n\n",

The new agentic AI everyone's hyping??\n\nI've studied ALL of it and still have zero clue what I'll be asked. Then I learn this MBB-adjacent tech consulting firm uses CASE INTERVIEWS. Are you kidding me?  \nI was already burnt out and couldn't bring myself to prep properly. Still went through with it - interviewer was nice but I absolutely tanked it. Could identify the business problem but completely blanked on ML solutions. She pivoted to fundamentals when she saw me drowning, but classical ML is so rare nowadays I was rusty AF.\n\nWent in with zero expectations since I knew I didn't prep, figured it'd be practice. But now that it's over, I feel completely burnt out. That fire that made me quit my job 3 years ago to pivot into data science? Gone. All I have is a sore ass from trying to straddle multiple boats while desperately keeping up with this field. The interviewer mentioned she got mentored when she joined many years ago - must be nice! What early-career person knows how to nail technical case interviews end-to-end?\n\n*I'm not cut out for this. Feels like the folks who made it in the 2010s pulled the ladder up behind them.*\n\nCan someone please make me feel better?",

        "body": "I really sympathize with your position, but if you knew the interview format and still didn't prep at all, I'm not sure why you expected anything. The fact that you couldn't speak to anything on ML in general and particularly for classical techniques for a pretend business problem probably implies you haven't practiced enough to apply them to a real business problem. I'm not going to say you've been sitting on your ass for 7 months because I'm sure you haven't been, but all of the billion hypothetical interview topics you mentioned are things you SHOULD have a very strong familiarity with, either via using them in projects (which you should be doing anyways) or reviewing flashcards or whatever in your spare time (which takes 20 minutes a day; med schoolers do it, it's not difficult). Hiring is shit right now, much worse than it was a few years ago, and seems to only want the best of the best unicorns, but that isn't an excuse for you to have a seeming lack of knowledge of very basic core competencies; if anything, that should be more motivation to suck it up and start going through textbooks/tutorials/projects until you could do interviews in your sleep.",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3. These are the resources and approaches I've personally used and recommend, I'm sure there are other good ones I am unaware of.\n4.

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad SDE Interview Experience (Outcome: Offer!!)\n\nHey everyone! Honestly can't even believe I'm writing with good news right now, I never in a million years thought this would happen to me. But this sub was really helpful to me while I was spiraling before receiving my offer, so hopefully I can help someone else by being transparent about my full process!\n\n# Timeline\n\nLate Februrary - Applied\n\nMid June - Received OA\n\nLate July - Received invitation to interview & availability survey (same day)\n\nAugust 4 - Loop\n\nAugust 7 - Offer\n\nAs you can see, the process was extremely slow and drawn out for me. I don't think this is typical, but I guess it can happen. When I received the OA, it was a total shock because I had assumed rejection after almost 4 months of silence. And then based on my performance in the OA, I assumed rejection again, so getting the interview was another huge shock :') But I've since learned that unless you specifically receive a rejection email, you're probably still in the running, no matter how long it's been. So have hope!\n\n# About Me & The Role\n\nI'm a May 2025 BSCS graduate from a slightly above-average private US university (not top tier but a handful of people land FAANG-level internships and jobs every year). I've had two previous internships, and both were at pretty mediocre companies. My GPA was good (graduated summa cum laude) and my projects were alright, but nothing amazing. I applied to the fungible SDE I New Grad position. So the way this position works is that you don't apply to a specific team or location. You just interview for a default SDE I position and if you pass the loop, they place you in a team afterwards. All I knew prior to my offer was that it was US-based, but no idea which specific location or team. If you'd like my exact job id, feel free to dm.\n\n# Online Assessment\n\nThe OA consisted of 2 DSA questions (I would say probably leetcode hard level), a work simulation, and a work style assessment. I did not do well on the coding part lol. I think I had TLE on a few test cases for the second problem, and I'm pretty sure my first problem's solution wasn't the cleanest either. I barely remember the questions and I obviously didn't get the optimal solutions so I can't tell you guys what concepts to study, sorry.\n\nHowever, I think the behavioral portion is weighted pretty heavily on this, considering I still got an interview despite that performance. At that point, I didn't know about Amazon's LPs, so I just answered everything honestly, and it worked out lol. But maybe brush up on the Leadership Principles if you want to prepare for the OA.\n\n# Final Loop\n\nI'm being purposely vague about the questions because I don't want to violate their policies. Please don't dm me asking exactly which questions I got. I don't think knowing that will help you much anyway, because the chances that you get the exact same ones I did are slim. Instead, I'll give you the broader concepts that they covered - make sure you practice a bunch of those types of problems, and you should be fine!\n\n**Round 1 (LP - probably bar raiser)**\n\nMy interviewer didn't have a technical background, which is why I assume he must have been the BR. The conversation was pretty casual; he told me at the start to try to respond in STAR format and use \"I\" statements rather than \"we\" - they're really looking for your specific contributions as an individual. Since I'm a recent grad, I drew most of my experiences from school projects, which I think is fine to do if you have limited industry experience. Be prepared for them to really dig into your answers. I got asked several follow-up questions for every story I told, so just make sure you actually know what you're talking about! He also often reiterated my own story to me to make sure he was representing me accurately, at which point I would either agree or elaborate with a few more points if I felt like he was missing any key details. At the end, we had time for me to ask him like 2 questions.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty decent about this round. I'm not sure how well I did at answering in STAR format because that's not something I've practiced a ton, but I tried to maintain a good balance of sharing enough details without getting way too granular (especially since my interviewer didn't know about the tech side of things). The interviewer was very nice but didn't give any clear indications as to how he thought I did.\n\n**Round 2 (LLD + DSA)**\n\nThis interviewer seemed much more serious than the first guy; we barely exchanged any pleasantries before we went straight into the coding problems.\n\nThe LLD problem I got was not as open-ended as \"design a parking lot\" - he gave me specific operations that the system had to accomplish, so there wasn't a ton of need for me to narrow the scope. It wasn't a problem I've seen before, but I guess kind of similar to the task management system or ATM. Again, smaller scope though. I think he was mainly looking for me to know what the appropriate data structures are to use, and to use them in a way that the code is extensible. I felt pretty good about my answer. I walked him through my thought process, implemented my initial design, then changed one data structure to another to optimize it. He asked me to explain the time and space complexity of each part of my code. I messed up here a little because I misremembered the time complexity of a certain operation on a data structure. (This was my biggest technical mistake throughout the whole loop. During the waiting game, I was feeling really bad about it - if you're in a similar situation, just remember that they don't expect you to be absolutely perfect, and everyone makes silly mistakes like that from time to time.) He asked a follow-up about how I would hypothetically extend my design to support another feature, which I explained but didn't code.\n\nThe DSA was like a leetcode medium graph traversal problem. I hadn't seen the exact problem before, but if you know one BFS/DFS problem, you kinda know them all. The approach was pretty clear, so I explained my thought process and then pretty much coded the whole thing out in one pass. He asked me to walk him through a test case, which I did, and then we ended the round with a few minutes of Q&A. I felt pretty good about this round overall too.\n\n**Round 3 (LP + DSA)**\n\nMy interviewer was an SDE II and not much older than me, so the conversation felt really relaxed. He only asked two behavioral questions and no follow-ups. I am currently working on a very interesting side project that I wanted them to know about, so I made sure to find a way to bring it up in this round since I couldn't in round 1 lol. He seemed very intrigued by it, so this round was off to a great start.\n\nThe DSA was another leetcode medium, this time a heap problem. It was very intuitive, so I explained my thought process and coded it out pretty quickly. He asked about optimizing a certain part of it, which I figured out could be done using a hash set. I did a dry run and explained the time and space complexity. We had a ton of time left, so he then asked me to write unit tests for it lol. After that, we still had like 20 minutes left, so we did a solid 5-10 minutes of Q&A/conversation, and then ended a little early. I think this round was probably my strongest - I got along super well with the interviewer and no hiccups at all!\n\n  \nAnd that was it! This is literally the only offer I got, but it only takes one! I was planning to go to grad school haha, I still can't believe that this is real life. I wish you all the best of luck with your interviews <3",

That's why the probing questions are important.\n\nI did an E5 loop too and was down leveled to E4, I think largely because my SD knowledge is theoretical when it comes to massive scaling. \n\nThe thing to remember is that an interview isn't a test, it's an evaluation of your current competencies as well as your potential to grow. If you feel shaky on SD, study all you can but be realistic about what you actually know. It might be you're an E4, and that's ok.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" in an interview. It's ok not to know everything. But, that admission should be followed by some kind of reasoning process. For example, if you're asked what kind database you'll use but you don't know of a specific one that fits your needs, you could say, \"I'm not sure, but I know it needs to be write optimized, and probably NoSQL because the data isn't highly relational and we're going to deal with higher write frequency than read\"\n\nThis shows the interviewer that while you don't have the answer now, you have the criteria to find it.

I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest\u2014it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI\u2019m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what\u2019s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it\u2019s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** \u2014 these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you\u2019ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it\u2019s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new\u2014but I *know* it\u2019s related to patterns I\u2019ve seen. And yet there\u2019s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom\u2014rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I\u2019m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I\u2019m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who\u2019ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

Although I\u2019m devastated for not crossing the finish line at Meta, I wanted to share my experience here in hopes it helps someone else.\n\nSpecial mention to u/CodingWithMinmer, your variant list is an absolute goldmine and formed the backbone of my prep plus hellointerview premium helped me a lot, their system design pattern is brilliantly crafted and balanced for each level. \n\nCoding\n\nScreening:\n\t\u2022\tLC 680 - Valid Palindrome II\n\t\u2022\tLC 863 - All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree\n\nLoop (can\u2019t share specifics due to NDA):\n\t\u2022\t4 problems in total \u2192 2x Medium (tree + graph) + 2x Hard\n\t\u2022\tI solved everything and completed test cases. In one, the interviewer didn\u2019t want me to code but just explain the approach.\n\nI think my coding rounds went excellent, followed all meta expectations such as asking questions, communicating throughout and running multiple test cases etc.\n\nFor coding I\u2019d suggest Stick to Meta tagged questions on Leetcode + Minhmer\u2019s list. That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you\u2019re familiar with their pattern) discussing \u201cbad\u201d solutions before I make my final pitch for \u201cgreat\u201d solution. But he said I\u2019m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, \u201cNo, I want the entire design.\u201d I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn\u2019t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t\u2022\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or \u201ctell me about yourself.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t\u2022\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn\u2019t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn\u2019t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it\u2019s not possible. She didn\u2019t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you\u2019ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI\u2019ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I\u2019ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn\u2019t cross the line. Now again I\u2019m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you\u2019re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn\u2019t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

I didn\u2019t expect that at all. I actually had some solid stories prepared, but that alone wasn\u2019t enough. The follow-up questions caught me off guard. My responses lacked depth, and I know I didn\u2019t do well. I really fumbled through that part.\n\n**Round 2**  \nThis round went better\u2014it even got extended by 30 minutes. It was a mix of coding and Leadership Principles. It started with \u201cTell me about yourself,\u201d and then moved into a coding problem: I was given an expression like `\"23*9/3+1-19\"` and had to evaluate it. I explained my approach, wrote the code, and walked through a dry run. After that, he asked two LP questions. This time, I felt more mentally prepared. I was able to come up with stories on the spot and handle the follow-ups better.\n\n**Round 3**  \nThis one also felt like it went well and got extended (not sure how long exactly). We jumped straight into coding\u2014the question was about finding a device with distinct identifiers. It was more like a networking-related problem, which I hadn\u2019t prepared for. Still, I managed to approach it logically, and the interviewer seemed happy with both my approach and code. After that, he asked a few embedded systems-related questions, which I was able to answer.\n\nToward the end, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked about any technical challenges he faced in his role. He shared his experience, and then threw the same question back at me. I wasn\u2019t ready for it, but I quickly adapted one of my past stories to fit. He seemed satisfied and even said, \u201cLet\u2019s see during training.\u201d\n\nAfter the whole process, I had mixed feelings. I was disappointed in myself for messing up the first round but also felt somewhat hopeful about the other two. Sadly, I got the rejection email.\n\nRight now, I just feel angry, frustrated, and sad. I keep wondering why I choked in the first round. Should I even feel good about how the last two rounds went? I don\u2019t know. Just mentally drained and needed to let it out.",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE-1 interview experience - USA New grad\n\nHello...\n\nFirstly I wanted to thank the people of this subreddit. Most of the post from here helped me a lot to understand how the interview process of amazon would be and what can I expect. Since I took a lot from this subreddit, I wanted to give it back and I hope my experience helps any other who is preparing.\n\nTimeline:  \nApplied: June 18th, 2025  \nOA: Last week of June, don't exactly remember the date  \nInterview availability form: July 4th, 2025  \nInterview schedule: Initially all the 3 rounds were scheduled on July 24th, 2025, but then the 2nd and 3rd rounds were re-scheduled on Aug 4th, 2025 due to unavailability of interviewer.  \nAug 6th: Final decision - Reject\n\nExperience:  \nRound 1: LeetCode - Started with selft intro and directly jumped to coding. Initially the interviewer said we are going to do 2 coding exercises, but then I wasn't able to solve the 2nd question. I was able to identify the underlying concepts and what I need to do to solve the problem, but can't able to code it correctly. So he gave me another question to solve, which I solved quickly. First 2 questions were graph based but the last one was hashmap based, thus I solved 2/3 questions. All from medium level difficulty. 2 from NeetCode and one was not so famous problem but still from leetcode, which I wasn't able to solve. Finally I asked some questions to the interviewer about amazon and it ended.\n\nRound 2: Leadership Principles - The interviewer just drilled me with leadership principles questions along with follow up for 40 mins straight and then ended by me asking few questions to him. Went smooth.\n\nRound 3: LP + LLD - Started with self intro and 2 LP questions for about 20 mins. And then a LLD problem for 20 to 25 mins. I'm not getting into the details of what the question is. Not any famous LLD questions like parkingLot or pizza shop. It was different, but wasn't too difficult as well. Open to any language and focus is on design more than correctness. No need of working solution, but I was asked to think out loud and say all of my thought process as I code. Initially just gave a basic OOPs design for it, but as the interviewer added complexity, I changed that to a Builder pattern which he said it made sense to adapt.

I'm first gen/low income, so this is a life-changing opportunity not just for me but for my family as well and I feel obligated to throw everything I have at it. Essentially how I got here is that previously I've been fortunate enough to be part of a first generation college program at a FAANG company that provided an internship the past two summers, and I saw the trading salaries and figured I had to give it a shot. I've done some Leetcode on and off for the first time over the past month, and my first ever live coding interview was Jane Street's first round last week, which I luckily managed to pass. I saw online about the overall structure of the full-day interview with multiple rounds before/after lunch, and honestly just feel so scared that such a life-changing opportunity is so close yet I probably will end up blowing it since I have so much less interview experience/knowledge than all of the insanely talented people applying. So, I decided why not make a Reddit account and ask people who might actually know something because literally anything would help. Might be shouting into the void, but is the style similar to the first round interview or do they bring in more Leetcode-style questions or systems/other questions outside general coding implementation? Also, to adjust my own and familial expectations, about what percent of people make it through final round?

They all went really well. I was happy and thought that with positive feedback I would be able to land the job.\n\nMy recruiter then called me with the feedback and said she would look for a team for me, which already felt strange because I had applied for a specific position. That role was already filled, so I was basically placed into a pool of applicants who passed the interviews (which had never happened to me before\u2014usually you apply for one position and either get considered or not).\n\nLong story short, after 9 months no team was found for me in either location. Preparing for those interviews required a lot of effort and sacrifice in my personal life. Then, two months ago, a new recruiter took over my case, but the same thing happened again: he said he would try to find a team. After one month, he told me I would probably need to re-interview this winter after a one-year freeze.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know if I want to go through all the interviews again. I\u2019m super sad and disappointed. Thanks, guys.",

My first solution only took to account a square matrix, which I quickly rectified once the interviewer brought it up. The second was a game-style problem \u2014 you had to move one position at a time in a linear array, but a robot could only jump a maximum of two spaces. If it jumped more, the game was lost. These were both medium-level LeetCode problems, and I cleared them confidently.\n\nRound 2 was purely behavioural \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Leadership Principles. Honestly, I smashed it. The interviewer seemed to really enjoy my answers. At the end, she even said, \u201cI hope to see you soon,\u201d which made me feel great.\n\nRound 3 was with a senior engineer, and it was rough. His demeanour threw me off a bit. The first half was more LP questions, but I didn\u2019t want to repeat stories from the previous round, so I made up new ones on the spot \u2014 in hindsight, I should\u2019ve just reused the stronger ones.\n\nThen came the coding challenge: implementing an LRU cache \u2014 where you remove the least recently used key-value pair when capacity is exceeded.\n\nAt one point, he asked about the limitations of using a dictionary for key-value storage. I started talking about thread locking, but he quickly corrected me, saying that Python is single-threaded and that this wasn\u2019t a valid concern. He hinted at memory as the real issue \u2014 that\u2019s when it finally clicked he was expecting a full LRU cache solution.\n\nI started coding it, explained my approach and covered both the time and space complexity \u2014 but unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could finish.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nOUTCOME\u2014 Rejected \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLooking back, I really believe that the last round is what cost me the offer. I just wish I had prepared more LeetCode patterns and system design-style problems beforehand. Right now, I feel like I failed \u2014 but I also know this isn\u2019t the end.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the process. We move forward.",

Its pretty simple with this one, you either grind leetcode (solve \\~100 mid problems, and you will be in a good shape), or use tools like [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoder  \n\\- system/tech designs.
