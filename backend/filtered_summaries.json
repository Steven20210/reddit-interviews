    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

I had practiced a lot of LeetCode in preparation for this round, especially topics like DFS, islands, flood fill, etc.\n\nSo, when the interviewer gave me a grid-based graph problem (very similar to a known LeetCode one), I recognized it immediately. I clearly told her I had seen similar problems before, then walked through the approach, explained the logic, and wrote the code.\n\nBut during the dry run, I messed up a minor part of the logic — I miscalculated the area when flipping a water cell. It was a slip under pressure.\n\nSuddenly, she asked:\n\n“Did you really write this code yourself or did you copy it from somewhere?”\n\nI said no — I had practiced this type of problem before because I knew the company focuses on graph/matrix patterns, and that’s how I remembered the structure. But I didn’t have any external help.\n\nShe didn’t comment further. Just said:\n\n“Thank you for giving the interview and participating.”\n\nThat was it.

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

A few days later, I got an email from a recruiter asking me to answer a few questions (attached screenshots). They mentioned the next step would be to submit my resume to the hiring team, but also said that an interview is not guaranteed.

The question was not at all LC or DSA, and instead asked to design an API backend for file-searching, with support for recursive searching in sub-directories. I was completely thrown off but tried my best and asked questions based on what I was given. Didn't really solve it in the end, so overall didn't go so great.\n\n*Could only go uphill from here right?*\n\n**Round 2 (Bar Raiser?)**\n\nSecond one went much better, the interviewer had a shadow with him and asked a lot more LPs and I think I did fairly well. He gave me a DSA problem which I solved using sliding window. I felt the solution I gave was kinda brute force-y and was asked for a possibly more optimal solution but wasn't able to come up with anything. Overall, much better than the first interviewer.\n\n**Round 3 (Hiring Manager)**\n\nThis could not have possibly gone any better. The interviewer was great and spent a lot of time asking LPs, with follow-ups, and was really easy to talk to. He gave me a LRU Cache question in the last 20-mins and I was trying my best not to smile 'cause I'd just solved it the day before.

And those were:\n\n* DSA Round\n* Android Platform Round\n* Machine Coding Round (Android)\n* HM Round\n\nLet's go thorugh each and every round one by one-\n\n**DSA Round** \\- In this round I was asked 2 DSA questions. The time duration of this round was 1 hour only and I had to solve both the questions in that time limit only.\n\nThe first question was from Graphs topic and I must say that I am not very strong in Graphs and I was not expecting any Graphs question but it was my first question.\n\nQuestion was similar to : [https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/)\n\nLiterally I took a lot of time to firstly understand the problem then came to an unoptimised approach to which interviewer was not that happy.\n\nThen after 30 minutes he presented me another question.\n\nQuestion was: [https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)\n\nI solved this problem optimially before the given time limit and the interviewer was happy with my solution.\n\nI totally lost my hope for next round but luckily I got call from recruiter the next day for next round :)\n\n**Android Platform Round** \\- This round mainly revolved around basic android topics like ViewModel and its working, Activities, Fragments, Jetpack Compose.\n\nInterviewer mainly dig deeper on topics like Services and its usecases which I comfortably answered.\n\nThere was no question from his side which I was not able to answer correctly.\n\nGot a call from recruiter that I had cleared this round as well. Scheduled my next round the same day.\n\n**Machine Coding Round** \\- In this round I was given a problem to design a E-Commerce app and how will I be managing the data between different screens.\n\nThe data should also be synced with the backend servers.\n\nSO I basically was given some 4-5 criterias or features to complete in 90 minutes with scalable and clean code.\n\nI followed MVVM + Clean Architecture in Android for this round. Firstly I told my approach to the interviewer and discussed a bit on this part.\n\nThen when we were on same ground I started coding and I did it really fast as I had to complete all the features in the given time limit.\n\nI did exceptionally well in this round that interviewer even praised me at last.\n\nThen I got a call that I am eligible for HM Round. It was then scheduled for the next day.\n\n**HM Round** \\- In this round the Hiring Manager discussed about my experience at Inmobi-Glance and I told whatever I had done in my 1.5 years of FTE at Inmobi-Glance.\n\nThen he passed me an open ended question to design a map app and I had to tell him my approach in such a way that it is optimal and can be transformed into a market ready app with that approach.\n\nWe discussed a lot and then he asked some really tough behavioural questions to me which I answered confidently.\n\nI felt this round as the most difficult one.\n\n**Unexpected happened** : I was celebrating my farewell at my office (Inmobi-Glance) and I was pretty confident to get the offer that dat on May 30. Then HR called me and told me that there is a good and a bad news for me. I was shocked to hear this.\n\nHe told me that the collective feedback is mostly positive and they can consider me for an offer but I had to go through a **Bar-Raiser Round** due to my average performance in **DSA Round**\n\nI literally was weeping from inside and multiple thoughts were running in my mind like: \"May be they have found someone else that's why to reject me taking another round\" etc etc.\n\nBut still I somehow managed myself and I agreed to his request.\n\nThe fact was that I also did not have any laptop to prepare for this round as I had submitted my mac back to my organization (Inmobi-Glance).\n\nI borrowed a laptop from my friend and logged in my leetcode account and started preparing from next day.\n\n**Bar-Raiser Round** \\- In this round I was asked 2 questions. And this round I would say was the most easy round.\n\nThe first question was based on \"Min-Heap\" which I solved optimally.\n\nThe second question was based on some strings like some word and pattern problem. I solved this also optimally.\n\nThen that evening I got a call from recruiter that I had successfully cleared this round as well.\n\nThey were ready to give me an offer. And after 2-3 days I had my compensation call with my HM.\n\nThere we discussed my compensation.\n\nCompensation details: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6817292/phonepe-offer-software-development-engin-e294/](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6817292/phonepe-offer-software-development-engin-e294/)\n\nNow please help what should I choose at this point of time ?\n\nShareChat or PhonePe ?\n\nPlease help me.",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 New Grad -US Interview ( Stressed out about the final verdict)I recently completed my Amazon SDE-1 New Grad (US) interview process, on July 24 and I have been very stressed out how the final outcome would be. I’d really appreciate your suggestions or feedback on my experience.\n\nRound 1 : (Bar Raiser)\nIn the first round, I performed exceptionally well. I engaged with the interviewer throughout the conversation and provided lengthy, well-structured responses using the STAR format and standard interviewing techniques. The interviewer was genuinely intrigued by some of my projects and went deep into the details during follow-ups. I believe I did well in this round. I even asked a few impressive questions to the interviewer and expressed my enthusiasm for joining Amazon. I also mentioned how comfortable I felt throughout the interview process.\n\nRound 2: (LP+ LLD)\nIn the second round, I was asked to present a project and discuss its technical aspects. I presented my project well and answered the interviewer’s questions thoroughly. I felt confident in my abilities and believed I had done well in this round as well.\nSimilar to the previous rounds, my LPs performed exceptionally well. I even came up with unique stories for different projects, different from the I used in Round 1. The interviewers were impressed by the research-based projects and decisions I made in my past endeavors. One of the interviewers posed technical questions about my projects, and I responded with a well-structured STAR format. Overall, my LP was good.\n\nThen comes the LLD, which seems to be a very small task and not something I’ve seen anywhere before. I started by listing out all the requirements and key features, then came up with solutions. I designed my drafted version, explained what I had done, and then gave a modified and better version of my modules based on the frequently changing requirements. I feel like I’ve done what I’ve been asked, except the design isn’t in OOD format because the task wasn’t in that format. Then, the Shadow asked me to identify the bugs and mentioned that there’s an edge case missing in it. I debugged my code but couldn’t find that edge case. I had mixed feelings for this round for my LLD. However, I feel like I’ve been actively communicating and keeping track of the requirements while coding it.\n\nRound 3 (Technical):\nDirectly jumped into the DSA and gave me two modified Leetcode-style questions.\n\nQuestion 1: It’s a variant of the Top k frequent items in a list problem, but with various edge cases and string manipulations involved. I gave my brute force approach and explained why it’s not a good solution. Then, I presented the hash map-based approach with two possible solutions: sorting by values or using a heap. I analyzed the complexities of both approaches. I implemented a fully working code, and the interviewer gave a small follow-up. I fixed my code to that change. Overall, he seemed satisfied.\n\nQuestion 2: With only 25 minutes left, the interviewer asked me to explain the solution while coding. It was a challenging LC graph question. I quickly came up with a solution because it was a combination of graph traversal and backtracking. I explained the question and started coding while talking. My pseudocode was fully executable and easy to understand. He asked me to explain the solution using the test case, and I explained the code. I quickly ran through the test case and gave the solution. I accidentally made the question a bit harder while asking the interviewer about the requirements, and my solution worked for it. Overall, he seemed satisfied with my approach. However, I made a mistake when he asked about the complexity of my code. I wasn’t entirely sure about it. But what I said was right when I checked after the interview. He then asked some follow-up questions about my approach and other technical questions related to it, and I answered them well. I feel confident about my performance in this round.\n\nI’m so stressed out about my final verdict. Based on your experiences, how would you rate this interview?

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE Final Interview Done (Nervous)I am posting this for a general feedback, I recently completed my final interview with Amazon for New Grad. It was 3x45min interview. First interview had a simple easy coding exercise, I kind of overthought the solution and made it complicated. But the interviewer gave a hint and I was able to come to the optimal solution that the interviewer wanted. The second interview did not go as smoothly as I expected, I did the whole questioning and thinking out loud process. The question was a LC medium/hard. Ultimately I gave a solution that was working but not the desired solution. The final interview I would say went the best, I actually enjoyed that interview even though the problem was a bit tough. It did not feel like an interview, it felt more like a team collaboration where we had back and forth conversation about edge cases and different approaches to the solution, brainstorming the optimal solution after mentioning the brute force case. In the end we also had discussion on how the problem and solution can be upscaled and how I would change the code to account for that. Ultimately I would rate the interviews as follows for satisfaction:\n\nInterview 1(Engineering Leader): 8/10\n\nInterview 2(SDE II): 6/10\n\nInterview 3(Engineering Manager): 10/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two interviews that I felt the most satisfied with, the interviewer were more senior in position.

    "raw": "Amazon UK SDE Intern Final Interview Experience/Questions (No LeetCode asked)Background: **Freshman with Sophomore level coursework, in an Asian university. No prior SDE experience, \\~30 LeetCode solved (lol). Shit resume, tbvh.**\n\nApplied to Amazon for shits and giggles, shit got serious when I got the OA, and completed it with **all test cases passed**. Started LeetCode \\*after\\* that. Somehow got the final interview despite being confident that the OAs were a mistake, and Amazon is going to be like oops, sorry.\n\nAnyways, after a few panic attacks and some desperate LeetCode later, I gave my final interview today.\n\nThe beginning felt quite like an unfolding disaster.\n\nI connected to Amazon Chime. Camera on. Interviewer connected. Amazon Chime died as soon as I had a glimpse of my interviewer's face. This happened twice. **Chime sucks balls.** I've got a laptop with excellent specs. Anyways, the interviewer said it's fine if the video isn't on. Sigh of relief. Introduces himself. **His English sucks**. He's Czech, I think, so no problem with the bad English on a personal level, but it was not ideal. English is not my first language either, but I'm fluent. Anyways, I think I answered the behavioral questions well in terms of content and format, but due to this English disparity, especially with my slight but definitely present Asian accent and his heavy Central European accent, I **had to repeat things more than a few times.** (I feel terrible for pissing on his English, but it was a very genuine problem for me.)\n\nAt this stage the interview was not a total disaster, but not looking very good. The coding round was where things got real weird. A **single question and it was not LeetCode**. Will not go into the specifics, but after a rapid round of Q&A with the interviewer, it boiled down to **initializing a datatype, sorting a list based on said datatype, and splicing the list.** I use Python, so, the final code ended up being like 13 lines long?  He asked me the **time complexities of the two functions** I created, some **basic questions about the datatyp**e I used (it was an existing datatype so easy), and then, the big question was... **how would I test the code**. Now, unit tests are a thing that I would use, but I have no idea how to write one. So instead, I just explained what I would do. Things like use a database which has both the raw data and the results we should get upon processing, run the raw data through the code and compare the results, and then for the sorted part, a for loop through the list to check if the value of each element is less than the preceding element. For the splicing, just... check the length of the returned list against the input given. He was like, okay, that's good, I think we're done with this.\n\nThen he asked me if I had any questions, and this is the part I felt went the best. I asked a few questions about what he said he's doing, in some detail, as it's in ML and I know stuff in that field. He almost seemed excited to talk about it. The interview ended on a good note, and I asked if we could connect on LinkedIn, and he said, I'll have to ask if there's a company policy on this, but feel free to find me and send a request (which I did soon after). He also told me to expect an answer within 5 days, as mentioned in the mail and on [amazon.jobs](https://amazon.jobs). \n\n**SO. Can anyone tell me how did this interview actually go? I think it went well, for the conditions I was in, but could this lead to an offer or it's gonna be a no? Opinions and advice, welcome.**\n\n**Also. This coding without LeetCode? Is this a thing? How many of you have gotten questions like this? Does this happen usually? Could Amazon be deploying a new hiring strategy? Opinions on this too.**",

I touched upon the brute force solution with runtime and then tried to come up with a DP solution. I tried to explain to him but he seems confused even though I'm sure mine solution was right. And then he said, let's move on to the second question. The second one is easier so it was straightforward and I think he understands what I was doing. After that, he asked another question about if I can write a single solution for both problem (they quite similar) and then I assume there is one so I tried so hard but couldn't think of anything. He was smiling seeing me struggle and then I asked him to give me a hint. Turns out it's impossible to do so and we had like a good discussion about it so. And then, he came back to first question and asked me again how did I come up with the DP, and I tried to explain to him again but he's still confused so I offered to walk through an example. However, we already spent an hour at that time (interview supposed to be 45') so he said we do not have enough time. And then he asked if I have questions for him. I asked him two questions and seem like he liked the questions because he asked the same question before when he applied. And then, we ended the call and he said: \"THe HR team will get back to you for next steps\".

    "raw": "DRW Interview Experience - UI Engineer - OA / 45-min Technical ZoomHey all! Want to share my experience with DRW interviewing as a UI engineer.\n\n**My background**\n\nI've done a LOT of full-stack work, and a LOT of front-end. Probably over 400 hours in react, both in industry projects and my own. 200 of those hours are in NextJS, pages router and app router. And, all 400 hours in typescript. I know my way around these pieces of technology like the back of my hand.\n\n**OA (Passed)**\n\nGave a really simple question to modify a very basic react component. Required you to know the basics HTML elements, specifically the label and input elements, how to forward refs, etc\n\nQuestions 2 and 3 were LC easy/mediums.\n\n**45-min Technical Phone Screen (Rejeected)**\n\n45 minutes of Q&A type interview. DRW probably spent about 15 minutes on real-application experience, like the high level stuff about how react works, typings (unions, discriminated, etc etc ) nothing crazy.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of the interview were very technical. I was asked to talk about how Javascript worked under hood -- things like the event loop, and memory leaks in react. You were expected to know how async works under the hood as well (microtask queue, macrotask queue, call stack, memory heap, etc). I actually knew most oddly technical questions but did not know many of them by name because I had spent most of my time building as opposed to drowning in the documentation.\n\nI should also add 15 of those last 30 minutes were set aside for python. Is python static/dynamically typed, scoping (which is lexical), decorators, etc, which I got most of these things right.\n\nI was rejected 2 days after the interview.\n\n**My Consensus**\n\nI obviously have no hard feelings about not passing, despite my past background. DRW seemed to be filtering through a \"drowned-in-the-docs\" type of nerd, versus a \"build-fast build-hard\" nerd.\n\nFor me personally, I don't believe in the \"drowned-in-the-docs\" mentality, so both DRW and I would not have been a good fit regardless. (this does not mean I don't believe in writing good code. I know what is good code vs bad code, according to documentation)\n\nMost of what they asked about (e.g. technical stuff) I've almost never had to even think about during development -- and for good reason. JavaScript is designed in a way where you don't necessarily have to understand the inner workings, as long as you understand the implementation and how to implement properly according to the docs.\n\nBest of luck to anyone out there getting this call!

Just seemed like talking to a cool guy and didn't feel pressure. We talked about college and cs in general, talked about where we think tech is going, AI, etc.\n* We started talking about chatgpt and he began delving more into the role, explained that GPT is expected to be used to check our code before we relay it to them.\n* Almost out of nowhere, he asked if I had the paid GPT-4, and I said yes, and he asked me to share my screen for a little exercise. Was caught off guard because recruiter didn't mention there would be a technical component\n* I started getting pretty nervous but really he just wanted to see how i'd approach an issue. He sent me a block of code and showed me in his local environment an example of a bug on their site. He asked me how I would approach this and he had me diagnose the issue in front of him to present three possible solutions.\n* He seemed really interested in how I wrote prompts for GPT. I was playing it safe the first couple times and he urged me to just pretend he wasn't there. I did eventually ease up and gave him what i thought were the top three solutions.\n* He asked me why I didn't choose another possible solution and wanted me to justify\n* After all of this it went back to being casual and he thanked me for being a good sport. We chatted a little bit longer and I got to ask some questions. Then he said the recruiter would be in touch. I have a call scheduled with the recruiter this week\n* After the interview finished I felt like I didn't do that great, but the recruiter emailed me the next day and said she got good feedback.

I didn't know a thing about it but since I did apply here and wasn't hearing back from anywhere I applied, I decided to go. Spent the whole night and the time before the interview to learn concepts, which tools are used and the purpose behind them in DevOps. I made a mistake to not go through the basic programming concepts. Coming on to the interview, the interviewer asked me to mention the pillars of  OOP and I just froze there because I couldn't remember them. I told him that I use these concepts in my day to day life but I couldn't remember which concept meant which term. Naturally, he wasn't amused. He then asked me some technical terms that I had never heard in my life to which I answered that I didn't know. After a few more questions, he asked me to answer a trick question. I got it wrong and couldn't figure it out. In the end, he basically said that for a guy in his last year , I have poor programming concepts and have a low IQ because I couldn't solve his trick question( this made me really furious).

    "raw": "Palantir Interview Prep (Intern & New Grad) + Rejection copeHello person looking for how to prep for a Palantir interview! Congrats on getting here, your mental toil has just begun!\n\nI got all the way to the final round (hiring manager) just to be rejected for god knows why (they won't ever tell you because they ghost after). So now out of anger and sadness, I hope I can help out those of you in the future to prepare for this 5 round process.\n\nInterview 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThere is nothing very deep about this one, you just need to suck up to them and say how much you find the company and culture interesting and appealing. Talk about your experience and how it can relate to the work they do. I was told during this call that I'll be moving forward and I've heard that this is generally the case, so if you don't get told that your chances might be slim.\n\nInterview 2: First technical coding interview\n\nThey used to use a third party for this but now they get their engineers to do it which I guess is better? It's just 1 question (in my case at least) set for 45 mins and was comparable to a leetcode medium. Practice with [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice) do as much as you can to get comfortable with all basic algo concepts and you should be fine. Here is a list of most frequently asked Palantir questions on leetcode too. I didn't get asked any of these questions during this round however, so this list is not all that they could ask. Be on your toes for this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jvw7wxexpsc1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a196ba619605ba35192af28bcb24c946d91f925\n\n \n\nInterview 3 + 4: Learning & Decomposition\n\nyes sir 2 interviews back to back! I was applying for London while in the states so I had to wake up early in the AM for this one. HAHA all that to get fucking rejected FUNNNNNN.\n\nAnyway, decomposition is purely just a system design question. But it won't be something like design an existing application. The question is much more vague and you should go over a couple possible design choices, explore each of them talking about their pros and cons then dive into one design. Question could be like: We want to make taxi driver's lives easier. We have data about 8000 of their routes. What could we do? As long as you know basic system design concepts and practices you should be golden. Here are some resources: Grokking system design is always good, I also found this guy on YouTube who does some really good videos for it too: [https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163)\n\nLearning is something unique. You cannot prepare for this what so ever in all honesty. They literally teach you a library, concept, or something of that sort and you have to use that new knowledge. In my case it was a concept, I was taught what it was and how it worked, given a function that did said concept + some documentation. I was then shown code, asked to explain what it did, then told to improve its efficiency. Overall this is probably the easiest of the three in my opinion. You can ask the interviewer as many questions as you want for clarification (which is a good thing) and then use your own problem solving skills to complete it. Be confident in yourself and you should be fine.\n\nAlso to mention, both of these rounds are 1h each, 15 mins first dedicated to behavioral then the actual interview.\n\nInterview 5 (Final): Hiring Manager (senior engineering manager)\n\nWelcome, to the final round. You should feel good about making it this far. I sure did... of course that all went away just as quick. This is a 1 hour interview. Supposed to be split roughly half behavioral, half technical. The technical can be literally whatever the hiring manager wants. It is said for many to be a repeat of the worst of your previous three interviews so either coding, decomp or learning again. Majority of them tend to be coding. Now for me it was coding. My question was from the leetcode list above which was great and made me feel more confident (ha like it helped) but its not always the case. I've heard its common to get more of a Data structure design question like LRU cache compared to algo design. So be prepared for that. People say for the behavioral they really grill you on both resume and why you want to work there. What your desired future career looks like and other questions of that sort. Its supposed to let you talk about your interests with the manager. My guy just looked and sounded pretty uninterested which made me worry (rightfully so). My behavioral was only 20 mins (on the dot btw) so yeah... I've heard that for others (who actually got the job) their behavioral was longer like 40 mins. For some they don't even have a technical too! But how long your behavioral is does not dictate success either. There is a guy who got to final round twice, both of which were only behavioral, and got rejected twice.... I believe if the manager seems more engaged its a good sign?\n\nI personally thought my hiring manager round was the best interview out of all of them. I had answers to every question, tried to engage in more of a conversational manner, aced the coding. Idk maybe I'm missing something but I shall never know!\n\nWell hopefully this info helped. I pray luck is on your side unlike it was for me. If you get rejected join the squad, we got tissues and alcohol. If you get accepted, Congratulations! I am so proud of you, and please refer me later thanks.",

Got 2-3 OA/ 1-2 initial HR interviews, but nothing to exciting, and no replies afterwards.\n\nThen Apple reached out to me for an SWE internship position which I applied 3-4 months back. In the job description it had listed both phd and masters are encouraged to apply. After getting ghosted for 10 days, rescheduling twice, I managed to do the interview.\n\nI had no idea what was going to be asked, as this is not a typical swe job, it is regarding a specific field. So I practised some leet code, but also studied/learned more about the position specific technology, strengthened my overall therotical background for that area.\n\nMy interview had no leetcode and only technical high level discussion about the specific area of research/tech with the team lead. And the interview that was supposed to last 30 minutes actually went over for 50 minutes. Thanks to my studies I had really good understanding of the field and I was able to answer all of the questions, and got pretty good feedback. Actually past 30 minute mark I was praying for interview to be over because I thought I was killing it, and didnt want to ruin my chances with a concept I didnt know.\n\nInterviewer was actually surprised that I knew some of the stuff he/she asked because it is not something that would be taught in masters. It was a pleasant discussion and although extremely nervous I had fun thinking/coming up with solutions to questions.\n\nI am just extremely happy that I actually manage to do an interview! I am just genuinely happy that I know someone read my CV, reached out to me and dedicated a time for interview. There is just something relieving about getting the recognition you need, even its just an interview. \n\nIt is extremely hard to get interviews at these big tech companies, but I dont think that means that you're unqualified. I thought I was not good enough, but my perception just changed with an interview invite. \n\nI know that cs job market is kind of though for new grads right now, but don't lose your confidence or hope. \n\nLast note, I don't believe I'll get the job because its \"Apple\", and there will be more competitive PhD students that outweight me with their higher level of education, but still I am hopeful, and this experience helped me get my confidence back.

    "raw": "a pleb's experience looking for an internshipGather around all, I've been fortunate enough to be able to sign an offer with a random non-tech company this week. But the full path to it is something worth sharing (I think).\n\n**About Me:**\n\nSecond year at UCLA studying a math-related major, 5'8\", 155 bench/245 squat/255 dl (pre-quarantine, rip gains), plat4 NA TFT loool\n\n**Summary of Resume**\n\n3.7 gpa with data structures and computer organization as relevant cs courses, research exp with grad student in stats, 1 full stack app, 2 tech-ish positions I held during high school at a local government agency, and a statistics related club with a small project completed.\n\n**Prefacing**\n\nI actually got a B- my first quarter in the intro to cs course so I was feeling pretty discouraged. Thankfully I got my shit together and improved a lot and regained some confidence in my skills.\n\n**Before actually applying**\n\nThe title is actually kind of not 100% true because I continued to do this while applying but I mostly did this before I applied anywhere. I practiced my dsa skills with LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview. I would usually read through sections of CTCI then do some problems in the book and then do some LeetCode problems related to the topics I just studied. I mainly focused on the core data structures in CTCI and did not pay much attention to the more advanced topics (AVL, Red Black trees etc.) After reviewing all my data structures, I practiced by selecting random LeetCode problems to recognize what data structure are good for different types of problems. I noticed that I sometimes struggle on implementation type problems. To remedy this, I did some problems from previous CodeForces Div 2 contests. I focused on problems A/B mostly because those problems generally focus more on pure implementation. By the end of the summer, I solved **134** LeetCode Problems (65 Easy/63 Medium/6 Hard) and maybe \\~20–30 CodeForces problems. The other thing I did was to update and spruce up my resume. What helped me a lot was getting my resume read by my upperclassmen friends/career counselors at school. It also helps to attend a resume workshop hosted to get an idea of how you should write things on your resume.\n\n**Applying**\n\nI started applying on August 27th. I cast a wide net for places I was willing to work at. My only real criteria for applying was that the position was paid. I’d get automated responses requesting for OAs (Online Assessments) or HireVues. OAs were a hit or miss but I felt that OAs let me know where my weak points were. HireVues were annoying but it definitely helped me prepare for answering behavioral questions. Notice I said automated responses, I don’t think I talked to a real recruiter until October. I’m not going to lie, it was kind of degrading to send out a slew of applications only to be ghosted or rejected. However, the only thing I could do was to keep applying and fix any weak spots in my resume. In the end, I sent out a total of **317** applications. I received referrals to 5 companies and all 5 of them ghosted/rejected me. Here's a nice [snakey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/FR1s31L.png) summarizing everything.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nThankfully, I had opportunities to interview come mid October. To prepare, I did a couple mock interviews to get used to broadcasting my thoughts while solving problems. I also reviewed my projects, resume, and OOP concepts, to be able to talk about them in depth. Finally, I read the section of CTCI on the behavioral interview and rehearsed some answers. I interviewed at three (non-tech) companies, two of them had a technical portion, and all of them had behavioral portions. I would personally classify them all as LeetCode easy questions. \n\n**Aftermath**\n\nI was fortunate enough to have receive two offers, one from a company related to education that I've personally never heard of and one from a large insurance company. I signed with the education related company because the engineers that interviewed me made it sound like it was a better place to work at (and TC is slightly higher har har).\n\n**Some Reflection**\n\nThe shotgunning a ton of applications was a little depressing to me because most of these companies ended up ghosting/rejecting me. I think it goes without saying that rejection stings even after 100, 200, 300 applications. But, the only thing I that kept me going was the hope that one recruiter will think I'm hot shit. For interviewing it was actually both exciting that I had an opportunity and frighteningly nerve wracking considering the abysmal response rate that I have. One thing that seemed to help me was to listen to some incredibly toxic music (Future) so I become incredibly toxic (jk) and confident. Then I take some deep breaths and turn up my charisma and charm to a 100 and kill the interview before my social anxiety cripples me in time for Zoom class where I mute myself and turn off my webcam (not really but you get the idea). Another interesting thing is that I thought not being a cs major would be a disadvantage but apparently some people just really liked to talk about math lol. I felt that the Leetcode that I've done was a little overkill considering the technical questions were \"easy\" but it's whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that sums up everything I have to say, GLGL to everyone still searching u can do it :-)",

It started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. My interviewer also went out of his way to give me feedback on my resume and tips on answering screening questions.\n\nLike the previous interview, the assignment itself was pretty simple, in concept. However, unlike the previous interview, it dealt heavily with DSA (though I'm pretty sure it can also be solved without DSA). My interviewer first asked me to just talk with him about different possible solutions. I just threw different ideas into the air and he commented on each possible solution (prompting me for more details if needed). After about 10 minutes, I started working on my implementation, talking about what I was doing and commenting each step of the way. There were a couple of bugs in my code, which I managed to fix. Afterward, my interviewer told me that my solution was the most-optimal implementation and then quizzed me on the time and storage complexity of the code.\n\nLike last time, after the coding section was a Q&A with my interviewer. He gave me detailed answers to all the questions I asked as well as some advice as a potential intern. Overall, I went way beyond the allotted time (about 2 and a half hours in total) though my interviewer said he noticed but just wanted me to have enough time to do my best work.\n\n**Results**  \nI heard back from my recruiter the following Monday, setting up a meeting for Wednesday. During the meeting, I officially received an offer for the internship.",

I get a lot of questions about how to prepare, which topics to focus on and the order to follow, etc so I thought I’d write a detailed guide breaking it down.\n\nThis guide splits the study process for coding interviews into four sets of questions, for a total of 75 questions. Each set is meant to achieve a specific learning goal.\n\nSet 1: Working With Algorithm Patterns (13 qs)  \nSet 2: Data Structures (24 qs, 16 high priority, 8 lower priority)  \nSet 3: DFS and BFS (21 qs)  \nSet 4: Greedy vs Dynamic Programming (11 qs)  \nMisc: Other Topics (6 qs)\n\n**How did I come up with this guide?**\n\nMy teaching experience, combined with breaking down the questions on the [Grind 169](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=28&hours=6) into categories, which you can find [here](https://visualleetcode.notion.site/d46d383b06874349b22ff9e469666606?v=f35b4780b54a49beb2bdd7bc425c9101&pvs=74).\n\nThere’s definitely a lot to cover!

Algorithm patterns are crucial because once you understand the fundamentals of a pattern, a whole class of related problems suddenly become *a lot* easier to solve.\n\n## How do you study algorithm patterns?\n\nTo learn the fundamentals of an algorithm pattern, start with a simple example problem that demonstrates why the pattern is useful. Use that problem to understand the basic structural components of the pattern. Then, apply what you learned by solving a few follow-up questions on your own.\n\nI’ve broken down the fundamentals and created animated solutions for the follow-up questions for the following algorithm patterns, which are a great place to start because they don’t require additional knowledge of data structures beyond arrays.\n\nMake sure you understand the types of questions that are a good fit for each pattern (covered in the fundamentals page for each pattern).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Two-Pointer

important?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Let's say you get a question which gives you a string, and asks you to return the longest substring within that string without repeating characters.Since this is asking for a substring within a string that meets a certain criteria (no repeating characters), you know this question is a [good candidate](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#when-do-i-use-this) for the sliding window.\n* You know that the sliding window pattern involves using two pointers to represent the current window, along with a data structure to store the contents of the window. You can immediately start thinking about the appropriate data structure (a set or a dictionary are good choices for this problem!) to use.\n* Now you’ve identified the structural components for this problem, you can begin to translate them into code, using a [template](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#template) for the sliding window as a starting point.\n\nThis is why algorithm patterns are important: once you’ve identified that a question is a good candidate for an algorithm pattern, you have a structured foundation from which to solve problem solving from.\n\n# Unit 2: Data Structures\n\nThis set of questions will teach you the **data structures you are most likely to encounter during the coding interview, and recognizing the types of problems that are best suited for each.**\n\nStart by understanding the operations that each data structure supports, as well as the asymptotic runtimes (Big-O) of each operation. Then, work through the sample problems to get a sense of how the data structure simplifies each problem.\n\nI’ve written up a guide and animated solutions to the follow-up questions for the Stack data structure.

    "raw": "Microsoft SWE Intern Interview ResultsHey yall,\n\nI wanted to share my recent experience with the Microsoft interview process. This is an update from my previous post. I applied online, submitted my resume, and, to my surprise, I received an email congratulating me on reaching the final interview round without any technical phone screens.\n\n# \n\n# My Background:\n\nI got a lot of questions asking how I got pushed to the final round, here are my qualifications:\n\n* Previous internship at defense company\n* Athlete in college\n* Technical Military experience\n* Minority\n\nI go to a liberal arts states school that is no where near ranked. I also have a very mediocre GPA at 3.1 but I seclude it from my resume so they wouldn't know. (they also never asked)\n\n# \n\n# My Prep:\n\nI scheduled the interviews around 3 weeks from the initial email. For preparations I never took Data Structures and Algorithms before so a lot of my time was learning DSA. I took a Udemy course by Scott Barret called:\n\n[Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://parsons.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)\n\nI was able to access this course for free due to my previous internship's Udemy Business account. It was incredibly helpful, especially because of the animations explaining each data structure and the coding problems after each lesson.\n\nI also used Leetcode, where my Leetcode Premium subscription allowed me to pinpoint the types of questions Microsoft asks. The Microsoft Explore Card had every question asked to me during my interview except one.\n\n# \n\n# Interview Day:\n\nOn the interview day, they scheduled a 6-hour block of time. In the morning, a recruiter brought everyone into a Microsoft Teams call to introduce everyone and answer questions. This person would be the one delivering the offer letter or the declination email.\n\nIn my first interview, I initially thought the interviewer wouldn't show up because he was 5 minutes late. Eventually, he arrived, and after introductions, he asked me a couple of questions about my resume. Then, he pasted a Leetcode Medium problem about Linked Lists into the Teams chat, which was also on the Microsoft Explore Card. He asked me to walk through a solution. I got most of the problem right, except for a crucial part about the data structure. After that, I asked him a series of questions I had prepared until the next interview.\n\nFor the second interview, it was a similar experience with the interviewer being about 5 minutes late. This interviewer seemed disinterested and preoccupied. We didn't exchange introductions; she simply went over my resume and asked questions about my previous internship. Afterward, she sent a Codility link where she presented three coding questions, all of which were relatively easy. I made a mistake with the first question because I didn't fully understand it. She allowed me to try again with some more common questions about Linked Lists, which I answered flawlessly. Once the coding was done, I attempted to ask her questions, but she said she had to leave after just one question and suggested connecting on LinkedIn if I had more. (She did not connect back lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results:\n\nExactly a week later, I received an email from the recruiter informing me that I did not pass the interview. However, I am not giving up. I plan to take the lessons from this experience, learn from them, and come back stronger. If any of you have questions, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer, but if they're too private, I might not be able to.\n\nLet's turn this moment of setback into one of motivation and resilience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for being an amazing community.",

I applied for the internship on August 28th and I heard back from my recruiter on August 31st. My interview was initially scheduled on September 16, but to \"unforeseen circumstances\", it ended up being pushed back to today, September 28.\n\n**Interview Process**  \nThe interview started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. I introduces myself (major, interests, etc.) then answered a couple of questions about my resume (robotics team, volunteer work, etc.) then we went directly into the coding assignment.\n\nThe assignment itself was pretty simple, akin to a LeetCode easy-ish medium. Specifically, it focused on string manipulation with a touch of DSA. My interviewer gave me a minute to think over the problem and gather my thoughts. I just voiced random ideas for the individual criteria until I had a rough plan on how I was going to implement it. After I told my interviewer my design, he said it sounded like it would work. I started my implementation while commenting each step of the algorithm, talking aloud the entire time I was working. I managed to implement a solution, which initially had a bug that I managed to fix, and ran some random test cases which worked until the very last test case. My interviewer managed to identify the bug, giving me a hint where I should look, but I couldn't manage to find and fix it before time ran out.\n\nAfter the coding section was a brief Q&A, with me asking him questions (why Uber, previous jobs, college major, advice for interns, etc.) and him answering my questions, though we went slightly over the 1 hour time slot.\n\n**Results**  \nI recieved an email from my recruiter about an hour and a half after my interview, letting me know that I moved onto the second interview.",

    "raw": "Walmart SWE Intern Summer 24' Interview ExperienceHi everyone,\n\nJust received an offer from Walmart, I wanna share the uncanny process and some other stuff.\n\n1. Applied on June 17th for Walmart GT. Crickets.\n2. Got email from recruiter on November 8th. (yeah, 5 months later...)\n3. First round w/ Karat. I can go into detail but there's a bunch of description everywhere. Basically 6 questions off some topics (hard af) and then 1 LC ez followed by 1 LC med.\n4. Final round interview scheduled day after my first round. This is where shit gets wonky. They informed me it will be behavioral only, assessing leadership etc. I looked online and people basically confirmed it would be behavioral, potentially some git vc questions. My interview came up and my guy was a complete no show. Not even late, just ghosted. Contacted my interviewer and he let me reschedule. Then I hop in the interview with anotha guy the next day, and the first thing homie does is open a word doc and we do some LC. I tried to tell him I already did my coding interview and they told me it would be behav only, but he didn't care. A lil hard to understand him. I had an LC ez followed by an LC med... again. Was able to solve both, and finally the guy wrapped up in 15 min with some \"Name a time when...\".\n5. This was over Thanksgiving break so I waited until the following week and emailed my recruiter this morning. He responded 2 hours later, said I got the offer in Sunnyvale.\n\nSome things I noted:\n\n\\- Def email your recruiter.  If I hadn't reached out maybe I'd have to wait a few more days or a week to hear back.\n\n\\- People don't seem to know what location they're assigned until later, but I noticed that both my final round interviewers (the no show and the next guy) were based in Sunnyvale, and I ended up getting Sunnyvale which is what I wanted, so I think that's a telltale sign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, Walmart is recruiting this late still, I'm currently in the final round for HPE and I have an interview this week for Juniper Networks as well. Don't give up, I see a bunch of people saying no ones hiring now before Christmas, but thats not my experience.

    "raw": "My Experience as a Data Engineer Intern at Columbia University Irving Medical CenterThis summer as a rising Junior going to Queens College in New York, I interned at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center as a Data Engineer Intern and long story short, it was definitely the best experience of my life. \n\nTo start, I got this internship through another company that offers students and grad students internships & full time jobs through a cover letter process. (They give your Resume & GPA as well but to apply to the selections they have you must send a cover letter). A lot of these companies they have listed are purely Biotech / Health related which wasn’t exactly what I wanted at the time but to be honest in this field you take what you can get.\n\nI applied 10 hours before the deadline and got my chance to see all the companies, with CUIMC being one of the first I applied to. They had multiple options for different mentors you could intern with. I wrote a quick cover letter stating how I thought I could contribute & why I wanted my current mentor. \n\nAbout two weeks later they got back to me with details of the internship & to set up an interview. I met with my current mentor and it was genuinely the best interview i’ve ever had. I suffer with very bad imposter syndrome so it was surprising to me when he found my resume amazing. He loved what I had for my skills and projects, with great remarks toward my Transcript as well (mind you I have a 2.4 GPA) and we continued to talk about what I could contribute to with details of multiple projects I could work on. We ended the interview with a talk about potentially staying on afterwards. I was ecstatic when it ended because for once I felt like maybe this was it.\n\nOnly a week later, I found out I was right. I was offered the position making 18.50 for 40 hours a week working from home whenever I wanted to. I happily accepted and started June 3rd. \n\nNow to finally talk about my experience, as it was nothing short of amazing.\n\nFrom the moment I came in I was greeted by the friendliest coworkers and my supervisor (mentor) was simply the chillest guy I’ve ever met. We had a chat about the project i’d be working on (Which I can’t give details about because we are planning to publish a paper!) and I started my onboarding process which is always a hassle. But he told me to just work from home for the rest of the week on my 2nd day lol.  \n\nA week later he hands me my own laptop to work from (Really awesome, 256gb RAM, nvidia GPU, massive memory, was really happy) & I got straight to work. \n\nWhat was really great about my project was that I got to build it from the ground up. I built the backend foundation in python. Gathering data from databases and running it through cleaning processes, visualization and output. Building my own database for our group and eventually having to build a mini front end that they could use to see how everything looked (I just used the Tkinter GUI). \n\nWe also had a great office, with windows larger than I ever seen & a view of new york I appreciated every time I saw it. \n\nThough I did have a lot of stressful moments trying to understand what I was even doing and fitting deadlines, it was really fulfilling when I did get it done. I always got positive feedback and my supervisor always told me I was crushing it. I got great remarks from all my peers and it was a great feeling.\n\nDuring this process I really learned so much. I discovered my real passion in CS which is to focus on the data path and work in the health sector, building tools for people to use. I feel that is where I shine the best. \n\nI end next week and i’m happy to say that I’ve been offered a part time position while I go to school making $25+, with talks of a full time position coming my way when I graduate. He told me the salaries for a full time position are typically greater than 90k which is amazing. I genuinely couldn’t be happier and i’m going to be graduating with so much experience in my belt. \n\nAll in all, it is not FAANG or bust! There’s so much out there that more CS majors could tap into.\n\nThere’s so much more I could talk about but I didn’t want to make this too long. Let me know if you have any questions!",

    "raw": "How A Software Engineer Used Facebook Ads To Land An Interview at RedditHey guys -\n\nHere's a fun story about how Chris Seline (a software engineer) used FB ads to target the CEO of Reddit and get an interview. Main lesson is that you don't need to keep blasting your resume - try to be creative :)\n\n\\----------\n\nThe traditional way to get a job interview is to submit your resume and pray.\n\nEveryone does this and it’s taken to be the default because it’s easy. You can send the same resume with the click of a button to totally different companies, no effort on your part other than preparing the resume.\n\nThere’s no way to stand out, no uniqueness.\n\nGenerally, the way to get around this is to ask for a referral or to reach out to someone at the company for some sort of informational interview. Both of these methods allow for a more personalized approach to job hunting.\n\nBut is it possible to go even one step further?\n\n**Stand Out**\n\nIn 2016, [Chris Seline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dumbfounder/) was coming off a failed startup and looking for new opportunities.\n\nUnlike most other people, though, Chris wasn’t a fan of the resume blast method.\n\nHis strategy was to target specific companies and try to get noticed creatively rather than use the traditional channels and get lost in the shuffle.\n\nChris decided that he really wanted to work for Reddit.\n\nHis plan was to write a [blog post](https://twicsy-blog.tumblr.com/post/135712326189/hey-reddit-lets-make-some-recommendations) and then email it to the CEO of Reddit.\n\nThe blog post is thorough - it’s 2000 words, technical, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into it.\n\nEven if Chris had emailed his post to the Reddit CEO, there’s a strong chance he would have gotten an interview. 99% of applicants don’t put this much effort into an application and receiving such a personalized email is a positive signal.\n\nBut Chris didn’t just email him.\n\n**Facebook Ads**\n\nHe decided to use Facebook Ads to target the CEO of Reddit (Steve Huffman).\n\nHere’s how he did it:\n\n1. Find the Reddit CEO’s public Facebook profile\n2. Use this to find out where he lived, what he liked, what he was interested in, etc\n3. Use the above to run a super targeted FB Ads Campaign\n\nNote that Chris only wanted *one* person to click on this Ad, that’s why he had to go super targeted.\n\nThe Ad simply said: \"Steve: Reddit needs Recommendations\"\n\n**The Result**\n\nChris ended up spending $10. The ad reached 197 people. 4 People clicked on it. One of them was the CEO of Reddit.\n\nNext thing you know, Reddit HR reached out to schedule an interview. Nicely done.\n\nI contacted Chris to find out if he actually got the job - here’s what he said:\n\n*I did not. It turns out they were just starting a search for \"head of search\" at Reddit, and asked if I would like to interview for that job. That would have been my dream job, and definitely worth a move across the country, even with 3 kids and a wife in tow (I live in DC), so naturally I was very excited and said yes. But after a few talks they thought I didn't have enough experience with big companies, so they asked if I would be interested in an IC role. I was, but I wasn't willing to move across the country for that, and they didn't want to hire remote workers. So that was that.*\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nThe reason this is a fun story is because of the FB Ads.\n\nBut I think what people may gloss over is the amount of time and research Chris put into writing the blog post that he eventually showed to the Reddit CEO.\n\nIf we go back to the beginning of this case study, notice how I mentioned that just blasting a resume to a company signals nothing unique and frankly a lack of effort.\n\nChris’ blog post was well researched, relevant, and made him stand out. The FB Ads targeting was just the cherry on top.\n\nNext time you see a job you really want to get, think about how you can go that one step further.\n\n**Thanks for reading**\n\nYou can view the original article with nice images [here](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-to-land-interview-using-fb-ads). I'll be in the comments if anyone wants to discuss :)\n\nI write case studies about tech careers for new grads. Would love it if you checked out my [newsletter](https://www.careerfair.io/).",

I guess it was enough since I got to the next stage.\n\n**OA2**: Work simulation on LP situations. Didn't think much of it and just did what I thought was the most obvious/ best response. This was submitted before Christmas.\n\n**Notice to schedule final interview**: One month after my OA2 submission, I heard back to schedule the final interview and select all dates in a survey that worked.

Later as I looked to the side to think for a second, he asked me \"why the fuck are you looking to the side\" (verbatim) and to focus on the screen, to which I apologized and kept going. He wasn't really angry, in fact he was laughing when he said it but at this point I was extremely uncomfortable and it was impossible to think through the problem. I was explaining my thought process and when I said something about popping a node from the stack he deadass replied \"Ayee pop it like it's hot\".\n\nHe then started getting impatient when I couldn't solve the problem and he started throwing out a lot of curse words in his hints (that weren't ever helpful) and then said \"C'mon you're a \\[T10 uni\\] student, show me some code\", which is probably one of the most demoralizing things I've been told. He ended it and asked me if I had any questions. I asked him how he liked Microsoft and he said you learn a lot but \"the pay is shit and the work is boring.\" I thanked him for his time and he said yeah and dc'ed (this was the first interview of the loop). Got rejected the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGG",

    "raw": "My Bloomberg interview experienceHello everyone,\n\nIn this post, I wanted to share my Bloomberg interview experience, how I prepared and final compensation offer I received. This was back in April and only recently I received the details of my compensation.\n\nYou can read this on my blog as well (which has better editing) - [https://dev.to/dfs\\_with\\_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb](https://dev.to/dfs_with_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb)\n\n# Interview Experience\n\nSo, I applied for a SWE role(not a new grad) and heard back from a Bloomberg recruiter in April. I scheduled my first technical phone screen three weeks from the time I was contacted.\n\nTechnical phone screen 45 minutes - My interviewer asked me questions on my resume for around 15 minutes and then gave me a variation of number of islands.\n\nThe next day I was contacted by my recruiter and I was informed I will be moving to the next round which is a virtual on-site that consists of technical rounds. I was asked to keep 3-4 hours aside for the rounds but I wasn't told how many rounds and what kind except that the first will be a technical round.\n\nMy virtual on-site started at 11am a week later. The first round was indeed a technical round with two interviewers. One of them was shadowing the main interviewer. My interviewer was nice, he introduced himself and gave me a brief overview of how the interview would be structured. Then we spent 15 minutes on my resume to understand what type of work I had done and what I am currently working on, what are my technical interests etc. Then we moved to the first problem. It was a very verbose problem on handling buy requests in the front office of a trading desk and it had multiple requirements. But I saw that all of the requirement aligned with implementing a min stack so I explained that to the interviewer. He was happy and allowed me to code up the solution. He asked me for the time complexity of each function and we discussed a bit on some of the edge cases. Next he gave me another problem on balanced parenthesis which was straightforward enough on the first attempt and I told him a stack approach. He was satisfied and I coded it up. Then he gave me a follow up to solve it without using a stack. I struggled a bit here and he was trying to nudge me in the right direction. I came up with an O(n\\^2) algorithm but he pushed me to give him a O(n) and constant space solution which I finally was able to come up with. The interviewer was quite satisfied and we ended there. It took about 1 hour. He told me I will have one more round in half an hour.\n\nMy next interviewer showed up in 15 minutes and he told me that he can wait for 15 more minutes because he was early. I told him that I am ready. So again we spoke for around 10 minutes about my resume and the he gave me the first question which was a variation of all paths from source to destination. I was able to come up with the solution quite easily and coded it up. Then he asked me the time complexity and I really struggled with it though it wasn't complicated at all. He had to finally tell me. We spent the same amount of time on the time complexity as that on the actual problem. My mind was kind of fried at that time. Since we had time, he gave me another problem involving hashmaps (it is one of the most frequently asked questions in Bloomberg). I was able to solve it because I had done the problem before and we finished before time. He informed me that I have an HR round in 45 minutes.\n\nHR round - lasted for 30 minutes and again I was asked about my previous work experience, how many people I would interact with, did I work with stakeholders, why am I doing a master's now and why in the US etc. The HR told me that I am done with the virtual on-site and my recruiter will let me know on the next steps\n\nIt was a while, I don't remember the exact time but I was contacted by my recruiter and they let me know that I had one more round this time with an engineering manager. I scheduled it for a week from the date I was informed.\n\nEM round - This was taken a very senior manager at Bloomberg(>25 YOE at Bloomberg). He wanted to know about my experience with different programming languages. He asked me to differentiate between C++,Python and Java, asked couple of standard behavioral questions and gave me advice on how to succeed as an engineer at Bloomberg.\n\nI was contacted by a different HR a week later and was told they are giving me a verbal offer but because I can't join them till 2023 beginning they can give me the comp details sometime in Aug because thats when they are going to finalize the details for 2023. It took them a bit more time than expected but they gave me the comp details few days back.\n\n# Compensation\n\nTotal TC - 182k (excluding benefits such as health insurance)\n\nEDIT - negotiated up for a total TC of 195k\n\n# How I prepared\n\nI had solved problems from CTCI on leetcode, solved majority of blind 75 problems and I had collected questions asked in previous Bloomberg interviews from leetcode discuss section and geeksforgeeks to prepare. I had started solving Leetcode problems from December end of last year and my final LC count(if that matters) on the day of my virtual on-site was 289.",

Apply and fill out the hiring assessment (competency questions about how you work and what you would do in different situations)\n2. 3 weeks later: Contacted by recruiter giving me information to schedule a live technical through Karat. The live technical was around a week later. Interview was 1hr long consisting of 6 questions on 2 topics of your choice. I chose OOP and Testing I think. Live coding was 45 minutes long. I had 2 med-easy questions. IDK if they were leetcode as I have never seen them before. I finished the first one pretty quick. First you are asked to explain your approach. Then you type some code and debug. I explained my solution and passed all the test cases in about 15-20 minutes. The second question was harder. It took more thinking. My first approach didn't account for some edge cases so I didn't have time to finish. I explained my new approach that actually worked (I tested this after the interview). I would have been able to write the new code if I had about 5 more minutes.\n3. Next Day: Got the email saying I passed and I needed to schedule the final behavioral interview. The behavioral was also a little over a week after I was notified I passed the technical. I interviewed with a Senior SWE and he was really nice and chill. Probably one of the nicest interviewers I have ever had. It lasted a little over 40 minutes. He asked 3 questions. They were technical and behavioral at the same time. You needed to talk about the technical side and it was also assessing your soft skills.\n4. Day after behavioral: Got my verbal offer from my recruiter.

There wasn't any coding during this particular individual interview, but she was asking technical questions. She was clearly super sleepy and having trouble keeping her eyes open - often she only had one eye open and was obviously struggling to stay awake.

Strangest interview experience ever, I honestly think she might have been on drugs.\n\nShe ended the interview early and wished me good luck.

I had an interview on Friday with a company at 1 pm and I was on the zoom call by 12:50. My interviewers showed up 10 mins late to a 45 minute interview so my time was already cut very short. One of the interviewer then struggled to turn her mic on for another 5 minutes and when she did it started echoing. After that, the interview started. This is for an internship position for an application development role. They asked me about multithreading and arrays vs linked lists. I told them I didn’t really know what multithreading was but I knew threads, and they continued to ask me large scale questions and grill me on it. After that we went into the coding round. They made me SCREENSHOT the problem and code on my own IDE while screen-sharing which I thought was so stupid, there are free code  share websites. The problem was a medium leetcode problem, and I knew the solution but I wrote my code in like 5 mins because I was heavily rushed to start coding by my interviewers and then when I was done and double checking it, they were like ok we’re gonna take a screenshot and move onto behavioral. I didn’t even get to run my code or test my code. They asked me two behavioral questions and then asked me about my cybersecurity minor and started grilling me on encryption algorithms when I told them I had not taken a course in encryption algorithms yet. But they continued to ask so I just tried to problem solve it. Then the interviewer looked at my resume and said so it looks like you have ML experience should I ask you about ML or operating systems? I just told him my only experience in ML is from a summer project for an internship and that I don’t know much after that. So he starts grilling me about operating systems, and I answer his questions correctly but the other interviewer keeps talking over me every time I say something slightly wrong she starts like talking over me and saying no. And then he’s like ok we’re out of time you have to ask us questions and I literally just asked them what their favorite part about the company was and they couldn’t even say anything about it. They said their teams, but nothing positive about the company. This interview was absolute garbage and I don’t think I did bad except for the topics which I told them I had no experience in that they continued to grill me on. My interviewers were rude and the set up / format for coding was horrendous. What do you guys think?

There are projects, there are moderators in our Discord helping people get situated, etc. but my gosh, this is a total train wreck.\n\nYes, it's free.  \nYes, it is *something* to put on your resume. However, this environment is absolute chaos, the program itself is disorganized, the co-founders have some red flag behavior, and communication down right sucks.  \n  \nLet's start off with the fact that 41,000 people applied and they accepted almost 16,000 people. Imagine *half* of those people in a single Discord, bombarding all the chats with questions because most of us have no idea what's going on. We receive information (like schedules, Zoom links) at the last minute, and when we do receive that information, it's incredibly broad and you come to accept that you're going to be confused for the next 7 weeks. \n\nNow, onto today--the day we were supposed to attend a kick-off meeting. Typically the co-founders will drop the link to the Zoom call in the #announcements channel. I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the link to drop. Nothing. I was at least an hour early, at my desk, plugged in and ready to click.  \nNot today, apparently. The link was sent by email (unless there is another place that I'd say 80% of us aren't aware of). I received the link MINUTES after the meeting was supposed to start, and when I tried to join, the Zoom call maxed out in attendance. \n\nWhy would you press the importance of attending the kick off meeting, accept 16,000 people, and only make it possible for 1,000 people to attend?\n\nBut wait, it gets better. Co-founder Yasin posts this in the announcements channel afterwards. \"we capped zoom to 1000. this was by choice for a few reasons: people who show up early will usually benefit earlier. Usually the people who apply early to jobs have a bigger advantage esp for f500 companies. This will be the easiest route for most to get a job.\"  \n???  \nAh, yes. Let's gaslight all the people who couldn't get into the Zoom call because Headstarter couldn't send a link on time. You want to see who shows up early? Send the link early. Let people show up 15 minutes early and stop accepting guests right when it starts. Honestly, it's big big red flag behavior. There's clearly a lack of organization or preparation on the founders' end, and instead they blamed it on fellows and made it sound like they did it on purpose.\n\nLet's also talk about the dashboard - I've been on the dashboard to see what I'm supposed to work on for the week and the due dates KEEP CHANGING. Right before my eyes! The day we're supposed to start working on our projects. The due dates change, the order changes, and some things are being completely removed from it. \n\nAnd then the co-founders are so quick to post about all the cool things they did on LinkedIn. I get it, I too post things I'm proud of on LinkedIn, but it feels inauthentic while 15,000 of us couldn't even join the kick off meeting.   \n  \nIt feels a lot like appearances.  \nBut also, *I'm* here for appearances, I just didn't think this fellowship would be as messy as it is. I was really excited and ready to go. I also wasn't expecting to see unaccountable CEO tech behavior right out the gate. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still participating. Game recognizes game.

Could you please suggest to me how to prepare for the next time (for other big tech companies also)?

    "raw": "How I went from low-level startup to FAANG in 3 months. AKA, Interview Tips & Tricks# General Notes\n\nI have decided to make this Mega Post as a \"pay-it-forward\" to the community. There has been a lot of great (and dear lord some not-so-great) content I've found over the past 3 months that have made me landing the job possible. The whole time, I was hoping I could just have a one-stop-shop for interviewing with FAANG, though, and I just couldn't find the \"perfect\" one I was after. My goal is to create that in this post. Mostly, because if I want to do this all over again in the way distant future, I can just reference this and be good to go.\n\nI also want to mention that this is coming from the perspective of someone who has 6 years in the industry as a Mobile (Android) Engineer. Therefore, while I do firmly believe a majority of this information is good for ALL Software Engineers, this will probably be most useful for Mobile Devs (Especially the System Design section). Sorry, not sorry - Mobile is definitely lacking in terms of System Design help out there.\n\n# General Tips & Tricks (TL;DR, in a way)\n\n* **You will get out what you put into the process.** This is going to be a very difficult process for many. These jobs are HARD to get. Even for the most talented of engineers, there is a game to be played that isn't well-known, or learned, during the day-to-days of the job. The only way to make it through is to put in the work.\n* **If you only want FAANG for the money, I'd strongly encourage you to just... not.** Like I mentioned above, it's a lot of work. A lot of stress. A lot of time and effort, and in some cases money goes into these interviews. These companies have been known to burn people out quickly. FAANG is not for everyone, though most discourse you find makes you feel like a failure if you aren't going after FAANG, or able to get into one. You *can* get into a FAANG company while hating the job, but no job is worth doing if you hate it that much. In this economy, I get it. We've got bills to pay, right? But you can still pay your bills as a non-FAANG software engineer and coast your whole life, without having to kill yourself trying to get in at FAANG and keep your job there (especially at a time of mass layoffs). There's no shame in that.\n* **Coding is not everything. It's not even worth half of your score.** I think the biggest mistake I see people make is putting all of their eggs in the basket of LeetCode - finding the most optimal solution. It's important, sure, but it's not even close to the most important part. More on this later.\n* **Interviewing someone costs a TON of money.** They want to remove people from the process as quickly as they possibly can. Make sure to take pre-screenings seriously. Majority of cuts happen at this point.\n\n# Step 0: Resume\n\n* **You are the best person to write your resume.** Do not pay someone else to write it for you or help fix it. Sure, ask a friend to proofread it, compare it to others, but don't just copy and paste.\n* **Don't just use buzzwords.** Sure, algorithms are looking at resumes, but they are looking for \"Java\", \"Integrated Testing\", etc. They are NOT searching for \"spearheaded\", \"plethora\", etc.\n* **However, wording does still matter.** Saying something like, \"Drove cross-functional outcomes with UX designers, backend engineers, and iOS engineers to create a consistent and scalable user experience across various applications,\" is typically more impactful than, \"Worked on Project Name with a full-stack team.\"\n* **No special formatting.** Like I mentioned, there is a lot of non-humans looking at your resume. Make it easy for the bots to understand it. As a general rule of thumb, I would avoid multiple columns, having lots of whitespace characters, and special page breaks.\n* **Include the following sections: Language, Skills, Experience, Leadership & Certifications/Awards, Education. Optionally, About Me.**\n   * Languages and Skills should be HIGHLY scannable, with *no extra* buzzwords. Do NOT put proficiency levels. Let certifications provide proficiency levels, do not rate yourself.\n   * If you are early in your career, you can probably remove the \"Leadership & Certifications/Awards\" section, you probably won't have enough for it to be in its own section.\n   * After your first engineering job, do not include your GPA, or too many details about your education. They aren't going to care about your Capstone projects after you have had real world experience, keep it just to a sentence or two, or maybe consider cutting it completely - especially if you are moving past 1 page.\n   * About Me is weirdly controversial. Some will argue it's reason for them to not hire you - or additional ways for bias to be added into the mix. Others argue it's great for differentiating yourself from others. I have personally landed on the side of, if I need it for formatting reasons - to make it a full page, or make the second page worth while, I'll add it, otherwise, I'll omit it. Definitely be careful about what you put here, saying you enjoy watching Hockey is all fun and games, but saying \"I'll never miss a single Maple Leafs game\" is a bit dicey - may seem like your inflexible.\n* **Put a lot of thought into results.** Companies want to know the *impact* you've made, not what you've been assigned to do. Even if you don't have quantifiable things (i.e.: Increased revenue by 15%), it's still worth trying to think through what changed as a result of you doing X (i.e.: Generated a personalized user experience powered by X, and Y by doing ABC\"). Here, the impact you made was allowing users to have a personalized experience by working on feature ABC with data X and Y. Think creatively here - DO NOT MAKE UP STUFF, but expand your horizons of what a result is. Revenue increase, app store rating increase, quicker code reviews, improved team/client satisfaction, reduced bug reports, etc.\n* **Make sure your resume is targeting the job you WANT not the job you HAVE.** Another mistake I see people make is writing your resume with a focus on mid-level items because that is your current level, when you are trying to get Senior at the next company. You may not be a \"leader\" right now, but think about any leadership skills you've done as a mid-level that can be used to put you in a senior-level light. Again, do not make things up, but even if you've mentored a single person, or led a single feature, write that down.\n* **Make slight changes to your resume for each job you are applying to.** If you are a full-stack developer, but the job is looking for strictly backend. Highlight the backend work - maybe add more detail there, even. If you are an Android dev, and it is clear the company is looking for Jetpack Compose devs, make sure that is listed near the top - potentially even remove XML if you don't think it's necessary. Look at the job listing, and make sure you've hit on the majority of it in your resume. Resumes take time, hours even. If you find you've \"applied to hundreds, but haven't heard back from one\" ask if you've put in the time for that specific job. If the answer is no, do better.\"\n* **Avoid pronouns when describing your experiences.** Don't put \"I worked on project...\" just say \"Worked on...\"\n\n# Step 1: Interacting with Recruiters\n\n* **Have some goddamn empathy.** Look, finding a job is an incredibly stressful time in your life. For most of us, we are looking for a new job because we dislike our current ones for one reason or another, or maybe it's for a big move. Just stress on stress on stress. And I get it, right? They're recruiters - this is their *job* - they should be willing to get on the phone with you at all hours of the day because this is what they are getting paid to do! Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say you gotta bullshit them. I'm not sending giftcards, or thank you notes - I'm not singing their praises back to them. But have some understanding for another human being who has 100s of you trying to get in touch with them on the regular - while they are also figuring out how people should best fill out paperwork, apply for citizenship, look for new candidates, etc. ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS when it feels like there are 1000s of applicants for a single job. You don't have to be a suck-up, but dear god understand when they don't respond to you within a few minutes.\n* **Ask questions as early as possible.** Not only could this look good as it shows you are putting in the work, and not leaving it to the last second, but it also gives them time to respond to you.\n* **Figure out the best way to get in touch with them.** One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is that they assume you can only communicate by e-mail, or maybe some tool. Not everyone is built the same. Straight up ask them, \"What is the best way I can get in touch with you?\" I've had some recruiters prefer texting, some comments on a Google Doc, some email, and some others in between. Help THEM help YOU. Make it as easy for them to respond, and they will probably do so.\n* **Prepare for the meetings you will have with them during the interview process.** It seems kind of silly that you have to prepare even just to meet with recruiters, when you are already killing yourself to prepare for the actual interview, but it's quite critical, in my opinion. I'm not saying you have to spend hours preparing for this interview, but do you know the best time you are guaranteed an answer to your questions? That's right, face-to-face. If you are meeting right before the phone-screen, make sure you have looked into what the phone-screen is for that company and come with any questions you have about it. Moving to the on-site? Here's only a billion questions I have about that. Team Matching - boom, here's some concerns I have there too. Write questions down if you need to. These things can be nerve-wracking, or happen very quickly, make sure you are organized to get through them all.\n* **Remember, they are here to help you, not hurt you.** It may be quite obvious, but typically they get paid if you get the job. Don't be afraid to ask questions - even if you are think they are silly. They *want* you getting the job. They will answer as much as they are legally allowed to. Don't be afraid to use them as a resource, but also, make sure you don't inundate them either. It's best to ask 10 questions at once, rather than 1 question every other day. Context switching is not fun for them either.\n\n# Step 2: Coding Rounds\n\n**General Tips & Tricks**\n\n* **I said it before, I'll say it again, you will get out of this what you put into the process.** You will not learn anything doing it once a week. You will not retain that information if you look at a topic once a month. You must continuously run drill over and over and over again.\n* **Don't compare yourself to other LeetCoders.** People cheat, people have no lives, people are weird. It doesn't matter how others are doing, what their ranks are, etc. I never did a single competition. It doesn't matter. FAANG isn't reaching out to you because you are the #237 LeetCoder in the world.\n* **You gotta learn how to walk before you can run.** It is super discouraging when you start LeetCode for the first time, pick a random question, and then think it's completely mumbo jumbo with no idea how to solve it. In those moments, take a step back, figure out how to solve it - what is the pattern/algorithm/structure/etc - and try again later. You gotta learn it before you can ever try to solve them on your own.\n* **Don't spend more than an hour struggling to find an answer.** There are so many resources out there that say you'll never learn by looking up a solution. And, to be fair, there is some merit to that if you just glance at the solution and that's it. But if you actually take the time to look it up, think about each line of code, what it's doing, read the explanation, walk through examples, etc. It will be worth it. After a while, I would reduce this time. You know you best, if you know you won't get a solution, just move on.\n* **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Getting an optimal solution working by the end is worth as little as 20% of the result.** If I could only pick one mistake I see people making, it is this. Engineers truly love seeing things as black-and-white as possible. Pass/Fail. No middle ground. They think if you get an optimal solution, they've immediately passed. That is not true at all. Sure, it's important, but you NEED to be able to talk about your thought process eloquently. You need to be able to discuss time and space complexities and tradeoffs between different approaches. You need to be able to walk through examples and bugfix on the spot. ALL of this matters. So many people miss 1 problem and think it's all over, or on the contrary, they know they did perfect on finding the optimal solution for the coding problems and are surprised they didn't get an offer. This notion is wildly incorrect. The way you come across in an interview matters a lot.\n\n**How Best To Prepare**\n\nThis particular section may be most helpful for people who struggle with LeetCode. For background, I took \"Algorithms and Data Structures\" in college, and failed the class. The only reason I didn't need to retake it is because a magical curve moved my grade from an F to a D, and that is technically enough to fill the required class. Safe to say, I knew almost nothing when I stared a few months back.\n\n* First thing I did, was PAY for LeetCode. You can either pay $35 a month for Leetcode Premium, or $13.25 a month if you pay for a full year upfront. I chose a full year. I definitely didn't need that, but I don't regret it either. As I've now accepted a role, I'm making way more than that. It was worth the upfront investment. The reason that is critical for people who don't know what they are doing is because they have courses meant to help you learn the concepts, not just rehash them. And also, you can see the Editorials for the problems which will go through various methods of solving each problem as well as time and space complexity analysis. As someone who didn't even understand the concept of time/space complexity this was worth every single goddamn penny.\n* Second thing I did, was the \"Learn\" courses found under the \"Explore\" tab. In this exact order, I did: Arrays 101, Array + String, Queue & Stack, Binary Tree, Recursion I, Recursion II, Graph, Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Heap, N-ary Tree, Trie, Comparator + Sorting.\n   * I highly recommend these courses. They do a great job at quickly explaining the topic, and then giving you problems related to it for you to do it on your own. Take for example, the Recursion II course. They introduce the topic of \"Backtracking\", and then have you immediately work on the N-Queens II problem to make sure you understand the concept. Then, just to be super-duper sure, they give you the template for such problems, before finally, throwing you into the deep end with 3 other Backtracking problems. Now, you can clearly see the name of the section, so you do get a clue that the problem is looking for a backtracking solution. Because of this, it's not the end-all-be-all. You won't get those clues in an interview, but it's great for learning patterns. I'm gonna drill into my head backtracking, backtracking, backtracking, and then what do you know? A few hours later, I know backtracking.\n* Third thing I did, was double down on some concepts I've seen people talking a lot about, \"Merge Intervals\" and \"Permutations\"\n* Fourth thing I did, was drill drill drill. For this, I recommend looking at curated lists with a little bit of everything. Some I found particularly useful were:\n   * Blind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit](https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit)\n   * Grind 169: [https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31](https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31)\n   * Grind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1](https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1)\n   * Neetcode 150: [https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5](https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5)\n   * (I didn't need this one for mobile, but incase it's helpful for others) SQL 45: [https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts](https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts)\n\nOverall, it took about a month and a half just to \"learn\" the things. Then I spent the next month and half just finding different lists to randomly go off of to make sure I stayed on top of it all. By the end of it, Mediums looked easy, and Hards were also looking Easy half the time. But I did **PUT IN THE WORK.** I spent *hours* on this daily. Including weekends. I didn't have much of a life outside of this for a while. If you already know the basic concepts, I doubt you'll need to go quite as hard, but it is possible if you want it. You just *really* have to want it.\n\n# Step 3: System Design (Mobile-Heavy) Round\n\nI often see people talking about this one like it's the hardest of the bunch. Everyone is different, so it might very well be the most difficult for you, but I think a lot of it is it's just the most *unknown* of the bunch. Coding is easy. You just grind out LeetCode for a while, you're probs good. Behavioral - I get it, don't be weird. But system design? What are they even LOOKING for.\n\n* **Engineers love for things to be in black and white - pass / fail, but system design isn't.** Instead, it's a way for the company to figure out what level you are operating at. Are you able to think big-picture like a Senior+ candidate, or are you only able to figure out where the basics fit in? Have you thought about - and probably *seen* a lot of edge cases / error states / etc.? The more detail you can provide, the better.\n* **Talk about the tradeoffs.** \"There are several ways we can store this data. We could use sharedPreferences, or a SQL database like Room, we could also use a NoSQL database. I'm going to go with X because of ABC.\" The more you can talk about your tradeoffs and the real-world experiences you are able to bring alongside that discussion is what truly separates senior+ from mid-.\n* **It's a conversation, not a lesson.** I see so many people make the mistake of going in with a set structure. A general idea of what to talk about is great - requirements, high-level, low-level, issues. But, it's important to note that this interview is NOT black or white. They just sit there talking AT the interviewer instead of working WITH the interviewer.\n* **You want to drive, but don't be afraid of using your interviewer as the GPS.** Take a moment to stop every couple of minutes and just say something like, \"Would you like me to spend more time discussing my reasoning for picking X, or would you like me to move on?\" Or maybe even something like, \"I think the most exciting part to take a deep-dive on is A, but is there something else you were hoping to cover - maybe B or C?\"\n\n**How Best to Prepare for MOBILE System Design**\n\n* **Work on brand new codebases.** Whether it's during your 9-to-5, open-source, side-project, whatever, the more you are thinking about architecting a project from the ground-up the better.\n* **Learn how the big guys are doing things.** Meta has a podcast where they talk about how they've built things to focus on Open Source. Google has blogs on blogs on blogs. ALL of these companies - including non-FAANG like Airbnb - have blogs about why the chose to do something. Or what they did instead once they realized things were not going the way they wanted it to. They typically are talking about tradeoffs at SCALE which is very important for these interviews.\n* **Watch mock interviewers.** I found Alex Lementuev's channel to be a decent resource. There truly isn't a lot of mobile-specific system design support, but he provides some feedback at the end of the interview that is helpful. It's also nice just as a general overview of how these interviews are ran. There's a few others over on YouTube as well. I do truly wish there was something better I could recommend, but unlike Backend / Web, there just isn't a lot out there it seems.\n* **Do mock interviews yourself.** There are several services for this. Find one you like the most, and go for it. Especially if you are unsure about what is expected, or talking in front of people. The more practice you have, the better.\n\n# Step 4: Behavioral Round\n\n* **I wrote up a specific post with more detail on Behavioral here.** [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral\\_interviews\\_are\\_more\\_important\\_than\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral_interviews_are_more_important_than_you/)\n* **Arguably one of the most important rounds for Software Engineers.** Whenever I see someone has been \"down-leveled\" or rejected, the first thing in my mind is *they messed up the behavioral part.* I am truly surprised at how little emphasis is put on this interview.\n* **This round is pivotal in determining which level you will be hired in at.** Just like your resume, you want to make sure your answers are showing impact at the level you are *wanting*, not the level you *have.* Looking for entry-level? You better show you are a good human being. Looking for mid-level? Make sure you highlight your ability to work with little oversight on your work. Senior? What impact are you having on your *team*? Staff+? What impact are you having on your *organization*?\n* **You cannot overprepare for this round.** You probably aren't spending as much time on this as you are LeetCode, but spend some time to really think about good examples in your job that are relevant to the position you are looking to get at the next company. Make sure you are thinking about the STAR method, and framing those examples accordingly. Also, for the love of god, *do not lie*. It is so easy to tell when people are making things up - don't think you are better than others at lying.\n* **Have an equal number of technical and leadership examples if you are looking at Senior+ jobs.** You are still trying for a *technical* leadership position. Don't forget the technical. But also, you are looking for the leadership side of things too. Be well-balanced, for every \"I mentored this person\" there should be a \"I had to walk back this architecture decision here\" kind of a thing.\n\n# Step 4: Team Matching\n\n* **See Step 1 above.** For real, be nice.\n* **Prepare to meet with Hiring Managers.** Similarly to preparing to meet with recruiters, you should also think about your meetings with HMs. This stage is all about finding out if this team is a good fit for you, and you are a good fit for them. What a good team for you looks like may be different than someone else. Think about what *you* need to thrive at work. You generally want to come up with questions for the HM that will help you figure out if the team is a good match for you or not.\n   * Maybe if being in the same office is important to you, you'd ask something like, \"Is the team all located in City X?\"\n   * Or if releasing products into the world is important you may ask something like, \"How often do you guys release updates?\"\n   * If you are motivated by promotions / title changes, you may be thinking about, \"What are the growth opportunities you see for this position?\"\n   * Nowadays, as the power is very much in employers hands, I would stay away from questions like, \"What is the work life balance\", \"What is the tech stack\", etc. unless those things are truly a make-or-break for you.\n* **It's not another interview, but it also kind of is nowadays.** There are way more people in team matching than it seems there are job openings. I've seen some people go from passing to match in 3 days, I've seen others go for 8+ months. You are competing against others, don't be rude. Ask good questions, be genuinely interested in the role. Take the first one you are even someone interested in.\n* **There is an element of luck to it no matter what you do.** We don't know what goes on behind the scenes. It could be that the person needs someone immediately - so they are only looking at candidates who already live in the area. Or maybe they do this one very specific thing in Rust, so they are only looking for people who mentioned that specific thing on their resume, etc. Embrace the craziness that is, try to find others in the same boat as you so you can laugh-cry about it all. Breathe in, breathe out, it will be okay.\n\n# Step 5: Offer and Negotiating\n\n* **You can negotiate often at FAANG, however, you must have data.** You can ask for a bonus of some kind if you are throwing away money to be there.

    "raw": "Microsoft Senior SWE Interview Experience (with offer)Here's a detailed breakdown of my recent interview experience with Microsoft. I hope it helps anyone preparing for a similar set of interviews!\n\n* **Microsoft Role:** Senior Software Engineer (Azure)\n* **Hiring Quota:** 5 spots available\n* **My Demographics:** White // Male // Millennial // 6 Years of Experience // US Citizen\n* **Current Role:** Staff SWE // Large startup // Fully remote\n* **Resume:** [https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg)\n* **Microsoft Offer:** Role: Senior SWE (L63) // Base: $176k // Signing Bonus: $15k // Stock: $120k over 4 years // Bonus: 0-30% // Fully remote\n\n# 05/04/2024 - Applied on website (found role on LinkedIn)\n\n# 05/16/2024 - Recruiter Email\n\nIncluded \\~20 questions. Questions were biographical/hr, background/experience, what you're looking for in your next role, and 2 role specific questions.\n\n# 06/18/2024 - Technical Screen\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (hiring manager)\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/) (domain/details were changed but problem was basically the same)\n* **How'd I do?** Fine. Didn't find an optimal solution. Barely found any real solution, tbh. Interviewer stepped in to help many times. I made the key insight to treat the data as a graph and I think that was required not to fail. I was very communicative and that's probably why I passed.\n\n# 07/01/2024 - Onsite Prep\n\n30 minute prep call with recruiter/scheduler.\n\n# 07/02/2024 - Onsite Rounds 1 & 2\n\nRound 1:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineer\n* **What?** 45 min. LeetCode, 15 min system design.\n* **Question?** [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/). Interviewer also expected it to be implemented in an object oriented manor.\n* **How'd I do?** I think I failed this one tbh and it got me down-leveled from 64 -> 63. I gave a solution involving binary search/inserts over a sorted list. Correct answer is min/max heap. It's a commonly known problem and I think the interviewer basically expected me to know it. Positive feedback was that I communicated well and structured the interface well, even if implementation was suboptimal.\n\nRound 2:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)\n* **How'd I do?** Perfect. I coincidentally did this one the day before, and I believe I had more experience than the interviewer.\n\n# 07/03/2024 - Onsite Rounds 3 & 4\n\nRound 3:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 30 min. LeetCode, 30 min system design.\n* **Question?** Basically create a class that lets you add/remove nodes from a tree. Started with coding, then asked to convert to distributed system.\n* **How'd I do?** Very positive feedback on the coding problem (super simple problem, but I think my communication went a long way). Fine feedback on the system design. Basically just had a client, load balancer, service, and database lol.\n\nRound 4:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (different from tech screen)\n* **What?** 15 min. technical/background discussion, 45. min system design.\n* **Question?**  Pretty challenging question about creating a aggregating all data for all tenants in Azure. The hard part is not making too many requests to any tenant/subscription at once (or else you'll rate limit the customer).\n* **How'd I do?** Okay. Was caught off guard since the recruiter told me this round would be all experience/culture. The solution is to query each tenant and add their subscriptions to a queue, then for each subscription in the queue add all their resources to another queue, then for each of those get the data. I tried some sort of Apache Spark scheduling thing to balance between tenants the interviewer didn't like. The interviewer told me the correct answer is to re-enqueue a job every time you hit a rate limit (with some jitter to prevent bunching). I didn't finish in time, but the interviewer gave me an extra hour to finish the whiteboard design and snapshotted it after.\n\n# 07/08/2024 - Initial Offer\n\nNegotiations ongoing.\n\n# 07/15/2024 - Final Offer\n\nOffered $194k base, and I declined the offer.\n\n# LC Stats\n\nFrom Jan 2024 when I started practicing until the day of the first onsite.\n\n* 2.2 problems per day\n* 31 active days\n* 68 solved problems\n* 24 easy (35%)\n* 44 medium (65%)\n* 0 hard (0%)\n* 80 attempts\n* 12 retries\n* 57.51% avg runtime\n* 47.19% avg memory\n* 0:30:20 avg problem\n* 1:15:50 avg day\n* 40:26:48 total time\n\n# My Top Resources\n\n* **LC Problem Selection:** [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)\n* **LC Solutions**: [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode)\n* **System Design Subjects:** [Jordan has no life Systems Design 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwt09KXDH94&list=PLjTveVh7FakLdTmm42TMxbN8PvVn5g4KJ&pp=iAQB)\n* **System Design Strategy:** [Hello Interview: System Design Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdPyoO6aXI&list=PL5q3E8eRUieWtYLmRU3z94-vGRcwKr9tM&pp=iAQB), [Hello Interview: Learn System Design in a Hurry](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* **Other:** [Senior Engineer's Guide To Microsoft's Interview Process and Questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft),",

    "raw": "My Google Interview ExperienceA few months back, I had my off-campus Google interview for the SWE role. I had like a month to prepare when I received the very first email. I asked some Googlers about their interview experiences and everyone, including on the internet mentioned that Graph and DP are the most asked topics in Google. I solved a lot of problems on DP, graphs, though I focused on other topics as well.\n\nIn first round, I was asked a question on graph. I was able to solve the warm-up as well as follow-up problem. The round went well. In the second round, I was given a 1-D array and solved the problem using two pointers. In the follow-up question, I first gave DP solution, then came up with the most optimal one after a hint given by the interviewer, which was again a two pointers solution.\n\nFew days later, I got call for the final round. This time I was expecting some good DP question. But in this round, I was given two strings. I started with a recursive solution and ended up with a linear solution in the last minute (again using two pointers), but I had no time left to code. I received rejection after few days.\n\nOne thing I learned from this experience is that we should go for an interview open-minded and never expect anything particular from the interview. Just because it's an XYZ company, does not mean it'll ask some advanced problems that you cannot think of under pressure. **It's not about the topic, it's about the concepts and thier implementations.**",

    "raw": "Meta E4 Onsite: RejectedIt's been a long road, but my Meta interview process finally came to an end today. Got the call 2 hours after completing the final interview that I wouldn't be moving forward.\n\nEven though I didn't pass, tbh I'm really proud of how far I've come. When the recruiter reached out to me in October, I hadn't interviewed in over 4 years and had forgotten all my DSA knowledge. Also knew nothing about system design.\n\nFor the next 2 months, I grinded Neetcode Blind 75 like crazy every day and it really paid off. Had my phone screen in January and couldn't believe it when I passed. Started grinding system design for 2-3 hours every single day to ramp up for the onsite as fast as possible. Never did SD before so this was all new to me. Did probably 30 peer mocks using Pramp and Exponent, as well as HelloInterview where I got really helpful feedback from real Meta interviewers.\n\nFinally had my onsite this week - 2 coding, 1 SD, 1 behavioral. I felt like I rocked the coding interviews, all thanks to Neetcode so was really happy about that. SD was definitely my weakest area as this was my first time doing it, feel like I didn't pass that one. Behavioral went good I thought.\n\nUltimately I think I had a chance, but since hiring is so competitive these days, and I've heard Meta is pausing E4 hiring (not sure if that's true), any weaknesses I had probably got magnified tenfold. It is what it is, at least I can relax now.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Neetcode is a national treasure and needs to be protected at all costs. What makes him great is not his ability to solve problems, but his ability to explain and break down problems, which I think is what interviewers actually value\n* Unless you're a genius, it is physically not possible to learn all of System Design in 1 month. This is because it's not enough to just study the basics, you need to go over several case studies so you're familiar with all types of systems, which is extremely time-consuming\n* Try as much as possible to do mocks with people who are better than you or have actually interviewed people before. They will give you the harsh feedback that is required to get better\n\nEdit: Just came across my [post from 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17o0l8v/how_to_approach_blind_75/).

I answered almost 90% of the questions correctly regarding python, deep learning, AI etc. \n\nNow this is a local company and has a set of very popular intelligence questions they ask everyone. A few of my friends that were interviewed there got asked the same questions each time so I knew. \n\nOne of these is: 'what's the angle between two hands of a clock at 3:15'. I even had the answer to this memorized, let alone the procedure. Obviously I didn't want the recruiter knowing this, so I did act a little confused at first before solving it. But apparently he caught on to it, because he then asked me to calculate the angle at 5:30. Because of this unexpected follow up and the interview pressure, my mind completely went blank. I couldn't even picture how 5:30 looks on the clock. I did reach the solution (i.e. 15 deg) but with a lot of help from the interviewer. He asked me to calculate the angle for 7:25 afterwards, for which I couldn't come up with anything even after thinking for like 5-6mins. \n\nHe'd figured out that I had the answer memorized, cause he kept saying during the follow up questions that, 'how did you solve the 3:15 one so easily? Use the same technique for this one as well, it's simple.'\n\nI felt so stupid for not practicing a general method for solving a question of this nature. The method I had in mind was specific to the 3:15 problem, so I was stumped on the other two qs. But at least I did learn a thing or two out of this experience. ",

You really need to practice problem solving under time constraints and the pressure of another person assessing you while you're trying to think.\n\nI was given leetcode #283 and for the life of me, I kind of froze, could not come up with any solution in my head other than creating a new array to place the non-zero elements. I needed tons of hints from the interviewer to solve the question. Eventually I coded up a working, in-place solution but it took 40 minutes. His feedback was that I did good at verifying the solution and fixing bugs along the way, as well as the fact that I actually was able to eventually code the solution. But he said it was quite frankly an easy warm up question and I really struggled with it, didn't even get to the second harder question he had planned, so I wouldn't have passed.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed considering I've been solving leetcode problems for the past 6 months, and even made an excel sheet with the top 75 Meta tagged questions that I've been going over these past 2 weeks.

    "raw": "Meta interview experience and preparation tips (London)Hey everyone, I've just secured a Meta IC4 role and wanted to share my experience and preparation process.  \nFor context, I have 9 YOE, mostly working at no-name companies doing full stack roles. I'm currently 2.5 years into my current role (startup) and haven't interviewed anywhere during that time. I also never did leetcode style interviews in the past.\n\nFrom receiving the initial call to final loop decision, it was a total of 8 weeks.\n\n# Screening\n\nFirst 2 weeks, did all the prep work material on the meta careers website.  \nTip: instead of watching the videos on the website look for the equivalent ones in hackerrank's youtube channel, they're also done by Gayle and have pretty much the same content, but much higher quality.\n\nAfter 2 weeks I had my mock interview.  \nDid ok, solved first problem and brute forced 2nd.  \nAt the end interviewer mentioned I was close to passing but **my code was not clean enough**.\n\nAfter this bought Leetcode premium and did 2 full weeks of just Meta top asked questions.  \nDid maybe 2-5 per day depending on how tired I was, as I didn't want to risk burning out.\n\nCome screening day, I got two variations of questions that I had seen before (mediums), solved them ok and proceeded to next round.\n\nTips:\n\n* -Make sure you write **clean** code, no unnecessary if's, no unnecessary variables, well named functions/variables, good identation to make it easier to read.\n* Always run a manual test case, this is your oportunity to catch bugs and fix them yourself before the interviewer intervenes.\n* Think out loud, this one is super important to keep your interviewer in the loop of what you're thinking. Sometimes your brain may be thinking one thing and you write another, this way they at least know what you were trying to do. (I do this often, saying \"A > B\", but write \"A < B\" or something like that). You can even just say read what you're typing out loud, that's fine and helps convey your thought process. I found it also helps me calm down my nerves, as the silence makes it worse.\n\n# Final loop\n\nI had 4 weeks to prepare for the final loop.\n\n**Product design**\n\nTo prepare for the Product Design interview I used: \n\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/@hello\\_interview/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hello_interview/videos)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk\\_bGCTde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk_bGCTde)\n\nTried a few others too, but ultimately these gave me the most bang for buck.\n\nI watched one just to get a hang of the process and then for all subsequent ones, I first tried to resolve it myself on Excalidraw and then watched the video and updated my design where it made sense.\n\nI spent the majority of the first 2 weeks on this.\n\n**Behavioural**\n\nFor preparing for behavioural it was a mix of watching random youtube videos and using the AI tool from hello interview: [https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai](https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai)\n\nI didn't apply the STAR method, and instead tried to set up my examples as *stories* and tried to make it interesting for the interviewer to listen to.\n\nI didn't spend much time on this, maybe 2 days.  \nIn hindsight, this was not enough.\n\n**Coding**\n\nIn the final 2 weeks, I could feel myself getting a bit rusty in regards to coding and started panicking.  \nI then spent the majority of the final two weeks doing more LC top last 6 months Meta tagged questions.\n\nIn hindsight this was too much.\n\n**Final interviews**\n\nI booked both coding for the same day.  \nThe first interview went very well, connected well with interviewer and solved both problems optimally with time to spare.  \nI don't remember seeing either of them, but I reckon LC medium.\n\nThe 2nd interview wasn't as good, solved the first exercise optimally but only brute forced the second one.\n\nOn the 2nd day I had behavioural + product design.\n\nBehavioural went *ok*, interviewer was mostly reading questions from a script which felt a bit off as the interview didn't have much flow.\n\nProduct design also wasn't perfect. I did connect better with the interviewer and we bounced ideas off each other, but overall I felt that time went by VERY quickly.  \nTip: Make sure you practice resolving these on a timer. Aim to be able to complete an end to end design in 30ish minutes, including deep dives.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nHad a call with the recruiter 3 days later.  \nOverall they were happy with my performance, and I ended up in between IC4 and IC5 as I ranked IC4 for behavioural and IC5 for product design.  \nI was suprised at getting the IC5 signal, as I thought I needed a perfect design to do so, but that **is not the case**.\n\nIn the end I was placed at IC4, which is a down level from my current role but then again my current role is not at FAANG and I've never worked at FAANG either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI found the process to be really good and well organised. The interviews are difficult, but they really want you to be able to present your best self and give you a lot of time and materials to prepare.\n\nOverall it was good that I managed to pass the interviews with a full time job and two toddlers, so there wasn't much time for preparing.   \nI did have to forfeit hobbies or other distractions during this time though.\n\nBut if I could do it, so can you!",

The only available time for the meeting was within 24 hours and I agreed. I spent the rest of the day and the following morning reviewing basic technical questions, general behavioral questions etc. I felt pretty confident going into the interview. One thing to note was that when I went to re-read what the position was that I was applying for, it was taken down and I couldn't access my application as it was locked, which was a bit concerning.\n\nIt was a 30 minute zoom interview which was scheduled with the manager of the department I was applying for and 3 other engineers on the team.\n\nBecause it was a 30 minute interview, I assumed it was just a screening--which it was, but since it was over zoom I still obviously dressed well and turned my camera on etc. I join the meeting a minute before the start time, and slowly waited for people to join. Took a few minutes, but before we started I realized I was just staring at myself and no one had their cameras on. Again, this is my *first* ever interview, so I don't know if this is normal? It felt extremely awkward from the get go.\n\nThey ask me some background about myself, why I'm interested in their company, which I genuinely was; it's an aerospace company, and I actually did my first year of college in aerospace, so it's something I'm relatively passionate about.\n\nAfter finishing that, it was just dead silent for about 30 seconds, and then \"Well, okay, can you explain one of these projects on your resume?\" Which I then proceeded to do, and explained the lifetime of the project, its goals and outcomes, challenges I faced and how I solved them etc.\n\nFor context, the project was a real-time album art displayer that was built with python and JavaScript which used an LED matrix and a Raspberry Pi, synchronized with Spotify through the Developer API. (There's more to the project, but that's really the only software integrated with hardware project I'd worked on so far, everything else is just purely software).\n\nI expressed a lot of interest in this project and was genuinely hoping for some reaction to it but again there was no visual cues as to what was going on, so I just sat there waiting for someone to ask something, which after a while was only asked if I'd worked on anymore projects with physical hardware implementation which I reluctantly responded with \"No, this was the first experience I'd had with it\" etc.\n\nI then explained another project I had done which was a website I built for my photography portfolio (side hobby / job of mine) using HTML, JS, MySQL, PHP and CSS. This was only responded to with, \"Well it's good that you also do your own projects too.\"\n\nAfter that, I was asked \"What's your favorite and least favorite part about Computer Science?\" This felt so... broad? I genuinely tried to give a good answer, saying I really enjoy building things with software that you can then interact with physically, but stumbled on what my \"least favorite part\" about CS was.\n\nThen I was asked, \"Do you know any legacy languages\" which I do not. So I responded with \"No, that's not something I've delved into myself, and along my college career we've only used more modern languages\".\n\nAwkward pause, then turned it to me to ask questions. I asked some things about what it's like interning for them, what kind of tasks you take on, how do you work as a team as an intern, and if there were any projects that they'd worked on that they found interesting (not sure if I should of asked the last one). Basically, the manager had to keep \"poking\" them by saying things like \"Do you guys want to chime in and answer?\" to which I got pretty bland responses like \"Yea we work as a team and there's always people you can talk to\".\n\nAfter that it wrapped up, I said thank you etc. and they said \"Alright, well that's about it. Bye.\" and left.\n\nI know this is an extremely lengthy post but I just cannot get it off my mind. It just felt so awkward, like they really did *not* care at all, and I really do feel like I had to have messed something up. They didn't ask *any* technical questions, and said they mostly work LabVIEW and... don't really program much so that was interesting.\n\nI don't know how to feel in all honesty. Just felt like getting it off my chest because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since the meeting earlier today. I don't really expect to hear anything worthwhile back, and it was a good learning experience, but man I really just feel like I somehow flopped.",

    "raw": "Meta's Product Design Vs System Design interviewI’ve been looking for resources comparing/contrasting Meta's Product Design and System Design interviews and here’s what I found.\n\n[This](https://thinksoftware.medium.com/grokking-the-product-design-vs-system-design-interviews-419520a65d49) Medium article seems to say I should be focusing on product requirements, customer impact, API details, and roadmap.\n\nIt also says “Don’t go into discussing the architectural implementation”, which differs from what I heard form my recruiter to still touch on those points without dwelling too much on them (show breadth of knowledge).\n\n[This](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook) interviewing.io article mentions nothing about customer focus, and instead says the focus should be data modeling and API params/response structure, but otherwise is similar to System Design\n\n[This](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/meta-system-vs-product-design?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=product-vs-system) hellointerview.com article has a bit of both, mentioning APIs, data modeling, and user experience as the primary concerns. But, like the Medium article, it also seems to imply steering clear of any discussion of architecture.\n\nI’m just getting mixed messages and would like some clarity on what I should be focusing on.\n\nSo here’s a list of questions (and I’m sure I’ll have more later):\n\n* How deep/shallow should I be with architecture? Should I just touch on it briefly, or is it worth discussing some tradeoffs there?\n* Should the frontend be discussed at all?\n* I can’t seem to find any mock interviews for this, so I’ve been watching/listening system design interviews on my commute, and trying to think how I would alter it for product design. Ideally, I would like to hear/see at least **one** good example of a successful product design interview. Any leads on where I might find mock Product design interviews?\n* When discussing the API, is it worth mentioning error codes, versioning, async tasks, and other niche topics?\n* Should I discuss gathering user metrics to inform decisions?\n* In a similar vein should I be focusing on the “soft design” (i.e. product requirements, customer impact, and future roadmap), or stick more to the \"hard design” (i.e. API and data models)?\n\nThanks in advance! My interview is Jan9 & 10\n\nP.S. Yes, I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17xjdgb/what_the_hell_is_the_difference_between_metas/) post, but I'm still unclear about the above questions\n\nUPDATE: So I took the interview, I passed, but at IC4 level. They weren't allowed to give any feedback, which sucks because I'd love to know where I fell short\n\nThe question centered around one feature, and since I used websockets I actually didn't have much of an API. So all that info about being API-centric (i.e. [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook),  [hellointerview](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/meta-system-vs-product-design?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=product-vs-system), and [this](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1173258/product-design-vs-systems-design-interview-at-fb-looking-for-study-prep-suggestions) leetcode comment from below) wasn't so applicable in my case.\n\nIt was pretty much a system design interview. Maybe that's just the direction I took it, but the interviewer seemed happy with the conversation.\n\n",

There is a YouTube channel for this which was really helpful.\n\nLink that contains neetcode list and the youtube videos: [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)\n\nAs I studied and solved each problem, I made notes of key points and saved code snippets in a Google doc for later revisions.

Had I solved them only once it would have been almost like solving a brand new problem during an actual interview.\n\nThe repeated revisions really made a big difference. When taking notes I added special notes on how one problem is similar to another and what exactly is the key difference. For example, different versions of sum problems - two sum I, II. Or coin change I, II or subsets etc. It really makes things much easier to remember and not confuse one with another if you see them side by side and focus hard on the differences.\n\nIn my interview I was able to apply the patterns I have learned and solve an unseen problem.

    "raw": "Interview Prep & Company Experiences - Detailed post**LONG POST ALERT. But worth it I promise.**\n\nI commented on a couple of posts and was asked a lot of questions about my interview prep and other details so decided on creating a post. Also I will keep adding details to this post as I remember details or get asked questions.  Please be kind. It took me forever to write this.\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This is how I prepared. Might not be the best approach for you but you can take this as another data point and see if you can improve on it or add it to your method of preparation.\n\n**About me**: 5 YOE, started preparing Jan 2022. Worked at Kindle, Alexa and AWS for all of that time and joining Google(L5 - Senior) in 2 weeks. Interviewed for a total of 11 companies and got an offer(or moved to offer stage) from 8 of those.\n\n# Preparation\n\n**Intro Call -** This is the first call with HR or the recruiter for the company. Most of the people don't prepare for this. And honestly you don't need to as long as you are clear in what you want from the interview process. Keep a short description of your work/role ready. Second, make sure you know what role you want to apply for and why are you looking for a change. If it is Senior you are targeting then mention that. Even if Recruiter says levelling is determined by interview performance you should mention that you are looking for Senior. Do not provide answers like I am looking for senior but will be okay with downlevel. Some recruiters might also ask your area of expertise (Frontend, backend, cloud etc). I had 5 bullet points which conveyed all of the information above. Everybody knows how to identify red flags but sometimes in the flow of things you might provide one which you will think about later. So keep information written and avoid speaking from outside of it.\n\n**Coding -** Alright so this is the obvious one. A lot of it is repetitive but I liked it since it made my speed of solving questions and understanding patterns better. I started with understanding concepts using Algoexpert since I was overwhelmed by the number of different type of problems when I opened leetcode. I was not bad but every time I solved a new type of problem I always had a question of have I solved all types now? So I went through major concepts in AlgoExpert all the while also solving leetcode equivalents (Easy + Mediums and only doing a couple hards every once in a few days in the beginning). Once I went through \\~75% of Algoexpert then I stopped using it in favor of leetcode. You can also use Neetcode or other methods instead of Algoexpert for concepts. No replacement of leetcode found for me lol. Some ways with which I improved problem over problem:\n\n1. Even though I solved a problem with ease, look at the provided solution and discussion board to understand better / other ways of solving something. This helps in sharpening your brain and maybe one approach would be faster and other would be less prone to errors etc.\n2. No IDE. I coded directly on leetcode without autocomplete. There is something comforting about being able to solve questions without any help and it paid off when all these companies had their own tool to test you.\n3. Time. I used leetcode timer to track how I was doing. 15 mins easy, 20 mins medium and 30 hard. I used to exceed the limits in the beginning but as time passed I was able to do more problems in the stipulated time. Start the timer when you start reading the question.\n4. Decide on approach and think about it fully before starting to code. Helps build critical thinking and fail fast habit. If you are able to think of failure scenarios before you are coding then you my friend are elite. I struggled in this one.\n5. Speak. This will sound weird but yeah, talk aloud when solving new questions since you will have to do it in an interview. I had multiple friends not crack interviews because they felt like telling each and every step of what you are doing is pointless. It might be in application development but not when you are proving to another person that you have what it takes.\n6. Structure your code and have proper variable names. There are rounds in certain companies which take this into account. Specially FAANG.\n7. And lastly, be humble. If you are able to solve more questions today than yesterday, keep that momentum going and do not let it get to your head. I struggled with this one in the beginning too lol.\n\nI solved company questions days before I interviewed for them and not before. Except Meta. Only solve company questions for that. Reasons listed below under company.\n\n**System Design -** You might or might not have this round based on the level you are interviewing for and the company. For this one if you have designed systems for your current employer then you are already half done. I had designed systems before but I wanted to know what is the structure of the interview and how to tackle questions all within an hour. Also obviously the different types of ambiguous questions you can get. I went through Alex Xu's System design interview book. (I used to read it when I got bored of coding or for breaks between coding days). It is the perfect starter. Moved on to Systems Expert and Grokking the system design. Each tool has something unique to provide.\n\n1. Alex Xu - simplified beginner stuff. Amazing if you want to dive in and read from scratch. Also the best chapter is the first one. Scaling.\n2. Systems Expert - Great for explanations and how do you move from topic to topic in interview. Understanding -> Requirements -> Data -> HLD -> Tradeoffs -> Questions -> Rewind\n3. Grokking - The types of problems and width of knowledge.\n4. Just taking up any random software you see and try to build it and then search. This is a true test. I picked up unconventional designs for practice like Query execution platform for a cloud DB, Robinhood, credit Karma or even IOS software update rollout.\n\nIf you are interviewing for something above L5 or an experienced L5 then you will need more material for depth as well. PS: Invest in a whiteboard if you can. Helps when you can draw things in 3 seconds when compared to 10.\n\n**Behavioural -** Not much here but keep examples of what you have done in the past ready. Some  Some common topics are:\n\n1. Your experience or projects you have worked in.\n2. Lead a project. How did you manage timelines, work with multiple people, how did the delivery of project go etc.\n3. Conflict Resolution. How did you solve arguments between you and others or between 2 people of your team.\n4. Best Practices. Your views about them and how to bring best practices in the team.\n\n**Offer Negotiation -** Congratulations you have moved to this stage. Make sure to have some numbers handy but don't provide the recruiter the numbers. Do your research about how much does a company pay for location, level and YOE. Check [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) for this. Get competing offers. Do not lie about offers since some companies ask for proof like Google. Try to schedule interviews such that you are getting offers around the same time. This can be discussed in intro call when the Recruiter tells you the process and how long it generally takes. You can ask for more time if required. All the best!\n\n# Interview Experiences\n\n**Google (Accepted offer L5) -** One of the best experiences I had. Every Interviewer was accommodating and all but one were a pleasure to talk to. Coding (3 rounds) was Mediums and Hard. I did good on 2 and did okay on one. They used some variation of google docs which I hated for interviews but here coding directly in leetcode helped. Solving company tagged questions based on frequency was a hit or miss. System Design was amazing. They asked me a question I had not solved before but luckily I was able to use some experience from the past and my prep to build solutions and talk about trade offs. The System Design interviewer was very accommodating and let me use a white board I had and kept taking notes so I don't have to draw on google docs. Focus is more on approach and how you tackle patterns rather than the final solution. Pro Tip: If you have experience and show that in Intro call you can ask to skip phone screen. I did the same. Getting full loop scheduled is always the best.\n\n**Meta (Offer high E5) -** Very different from Google. Focus is on **speed** and accuracy and not on approach. Solving company tagged questions was a 100% hit on phone screen plus actual coding rounds. This is also based on my friend's experiences as well. Speed is in bold because you are expected to solve 2 mediums in 35-40 mins. I hated the system design round. I read about this before that Meta system design interviewers are like a wall but my god. No expressions or words and me talking for 20 mins straight at a time. Not fun but helped me in subsequent interviews. I was told my performance here is what got me down levelled since I killed it in the coding rounds. Pro tip: when asked in interview to introduce yourself, do it in under 30 seconds. Do not take your own time away from coding / system design unless details are asked.\n\n**Microsoft (Offer 63) -** Very team specific interviews for some reason. I was asked a lot of coding questions that were related to OS. Scheduling etc (Leetcode Mediums). System design was very non generic. Again asked very OS style design. I was able to answer but was not confident until I got the offer call. Overall my experience was not great since I had to follow up with recruiter multiple times and they were not willing to give me more than a couple days in deciding on offer. I wonder if they were worried that I will not accept Microsoft if I get other offers. It is a great company, not sure why would they do that. Also heavy focus on YOE? I had to fight for the 63 round of interviews since recruiter said 62 is more suited for my YOE.\n\n**LinkedIn (Offer Staff) -** Great questions and people again. A healthy mix of company tagged questions (Leetcode mediums and one Hard total) and some new ones of well known concepts. System Design was great as it felt more like a discussion. Question was a bit unconventional so not sure if I performed great or okay. I had to give 2 days of interviews since I was first interviewed for a Senior and then Staff based on performance. The second was was a steep increase in difficulty and depth of knowledge test specially in System Design. Pro Tip: I missed mentioning which level I want to interview for here and since interviews differ by level in LinkedIn, mention it during recruiter call.\n\n**Uber (Offer L5A) -** By far the hardest interview in terms of coding. I was asked a total of 4 questions(2 mediums and 2 hards) in 2 interviews total. I had seen 1 medium before and knew how to solve the other medium and hard. The second hard was tricky and related to path finding. I got to know the optimal way of solving very late and then was not able to solve the full thing but conveyed my approach. System Design went okay. I did not have a good time with the interviewer here since to me it felt like after every 10 mins he would mention how great Uber is and the complexity of problems they solve there. I understand that a team/company might be doing something great but it should affect how you conduct interviews negatively. I would have deciding to go to Uber if I did not have a bad experience in that interview since I found out that the interviewer was going to be my colleague in the team.\n\n**Stripe (Offer L3) -** Best interview experience so far. Very different. No leetcode style questions. Simple questions which check how do you do development tasks and regular day to day dev work. I wish other orgs take this approach. Coding was very simple. Bug bash was good if you follow a structured approach and know how to use debugger of your favourite IDE. Integration was straight forward as well. What I really loved was the System Design. It felt natural and like I am actually designing a system at my current work. Kudos to Stripe for making the interview process so good.\n\n**Twitter (Offer Senior) -** Not much tips to give here. It was a simple interview process and the coding questions were 90% from the leetcode tagged questions list with a minor twist here and there. System Design was simple as well and was asked a very well known question. The only thing that was checked in my view was how deep I could go in data storage and access patterns.\n\n**Doordash (Offer E5) -** Almost all questions were from company tagged leetcode. Focus was on accuracy and edge cases. Good interview experience in terms of coding. System Design was very doordash products specific but can be solved if you have done all questions of grokking series. Nothing out of the ordinary here. If I had to rate the difficulty with Uber being 9/10, this would be a 4/10 along with Microsoft.\n\n**Databricks (Painful Rejection) -** Loooong process which takes forever to complete. Recruiter call -> Phone Screen -> Manager call -> Interviews -> Take home assignment -> Reference checks. I had fun till the Take home assignment since the interview questions were challenging but made sense and not your regular trick leetcode hards. Take home assignment was a lot of fun too since I actually learned new tricks while solving it during the course of 2 days. But why reference checks which need to include an ex manager? They pestered all the contacts I provided and grilled them with unnecessary questions. I was rejected based on reference checks? Pro tip: Do not interview here unless you actually wanna go here no matter what.\n\n**Upcoming Startup (Rejected, cannot name for some reasons) -** I was just done with interviewing by this point and tired. Also I had less motivation since I already had some offers. Shame because that means I wasted time of the interviewers. During one of the coding questions I blanked and was not even able to give a brute force approach. Bad day for me. Lesson: never interview more than required. There is definitely such a thing as mental tiredness.\n\n**ByteDance (Ghosted) -** The interview was split in 2 rounds. 2 coding and then after clearing that 1 more coding and system design etc. I cleared the 2 coding where questions were completely new but like Medium/Medium-Hard. Recruiter scheduled the next round of interviews the week after and sent a mail day before cancelling the interviews and said would reschedule. Never heard back even after sending multiple mails? Weird.\n\nYou can ask me questions below and I will try to answer or add it to the post here.",

The interviewer was rude and kept stopping me in the middle of my answers, dismissing what I was saying, and kept getting annoyed. At the end, when he asked if I have questions, i asked him what he expects from the person joining the role, and he told me to read the job description. I also asked him about the testing process (cuz it was a QA role), and he said it’s confidential and he can’t tell me anything. Even tho I’m literally interviewing for the job???",

    "raw": "Goolge Software Eng Interview Experience(L4 to L3 downlevel)\nHey everyone.\n\nI was reached out by a Recruiter in early December for an L4 role. All interviews (1 phone screen and 3 coding and 1 behavioural) happened. The feedback was:\n\nPhone screen: hire for L4, strong hire for L3. He said if code was modular, it would have been SH.\n\nRound 1: Hire\n\nRound 2:, No Hire\n\nRound 3: Kinda mixed. Lean hire for L4 but debugging, coding etc were very good. He asked a warm up & the main problem. But in feedback, he said he had one more problem to ask and hence gave lean L4.\n\nBehavioural: recruiter said it's positive and interviewer gave good feedback.\n\nExtra Coding round: I asked recruiter to have one more round to compensate No Hire round. She said it's positive(didn't mention it was hire/lean hire).\n\nDue to No Hire round, had a few team matching before going to hiring committee. 2 HMs showed interest(after team match call), out of which 1 position got closed. The other HM approved and the packet went to hiring committee.\n\nThe hiring committee gave Hire for L3 but No hire for L4.\n\nThe no hire interviewer fuc\\*\\*d me.\n\n**Background**: He asked a simple range max problem on array. To which I gave segment tree solution. Now during explanation he asked me to prove why **search** is logN, which I explained intuitively(like we divide the array in half each time and store answer, max height of tree will be logN). He said if during search query(l, r) you are going *max(query(l, mid), query(mid+1, r))*, here you are going both side of tree so how come it will be logN. I said it will go left/right some constant number of times and eventually some range will satisfy and it won't go further.\n\nbut then he said \"I understand what you are saying, but your answer is not conclusive and you need to prove mathematically\". Which I tried and couldn't do.\n\nThen during implementation it took me 4-5 minutes to write build function (last time I implemented it was in 2019 :( ) and missed the base condition, he pointed it out and I fixed it. Solution was completed. He said looks good.\n\nBut in feedback this guy wrote very bad feedback like:\n\n1. Gave solution but couldn't explain complexity. Fine\n2. He exaggerated the base condition miss in feedback : \"implemented a solution which would run infinitely and candidate fixed it only after explicitly pointing out...\". Even though during interview he simply asked me, when will this function stop and I quickly realised, explained and fixed it.\n\nI know it's my fault as well for 2nd round that I was slow but I really hate the feedback given by the interviewer. It's very tough to prove some things like greedy solutions, algo's like randomized quick sort will be NlogN etc. Idk why he judged purely based on one simple thing. It just frustrates me, I feel no amount of preparation could have saved me from that \"prove mathematically\" question he asked.\n\n\n\nDue to which the HC feedback says that the \"candidate took more time during implementation and hence not going with L4, but L3. They did not consider the extra round saying 'coming up with solution was slow for 2nd round and additional round cann't compensate that'\" like what bro. It depends on problem as well. How can you judge the problem solving based on 1 thing.\n\nI have around \\~2.5 years of experience at a mid size product startup as SDE2.\n\nMy Current base is above 25, no stocks. is it worth joining as L3? India.\n\nWasted a lot of my time, the process started in Jan and it's april :(\n\nI am looking for a change rn, have applied at several places but mostly get Thank you:(\n\nLooking for suggestions, what I should do. I am mostly looking for Backend work, no specific tech stack but I prefer strogly types languages. Remote work will also work for me. Leetcode: [https://leetcode.com/overkiller\\_xd/](https://leetcode.com/overkiller_xd/)\n\nCurrent Tech stack: Java, Spring, K8s\n\nThank for your time, reading this.",
