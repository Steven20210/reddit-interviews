    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

I felt the solution I gave was kinda brute force-y and was asked for a possibly more optimal solution but wasn't able to come up with anything. Overall, much better than the first interviewer.\n\n**Round 3 (Hiring Manager)**\n\nThis could not have possibly gone any better. The interviewer was great and spent a lot of time asking LPs, with follow-ups, and was really easy to talk to. He gave me a LRU Cache question in the last 20-mins and I was trying my best not to smile 'cause I'd just solved it the day before. I gave the brute force explanation and solved it in time using doubly linked lists with explanations.\n\nIt's been 4 days now and I was hoping to have heard back by Friday, but guess I'll have to wait till Monday. Hoping for an offer, I felt I did well in the last two rounds to make up for the first and feel I did well in my LPs too. Hopefully this was helpful for anyone preparing.\n\n**Update:** Rejected after 5 business days :P",

So, I thought I will be fast rejected by this round. 😇\n\n\n\nSecond round problem was OOP to build switchable cache class by user's choice. user can choose time-based or size-based cache limitation. For example, if user select time-based cache, remove all expired items after 5 min from input time. if user select size-based cache, when the size with new item is over limitation, remove any items to maintain the size <= limitation. Yeah, it was not too hard. But, I messed up because I didn't consider many edge cases like,  new\\_item\\_size > limitation. \n\n\n\nSystem design problem was about Amazon ads to update clicking numbers of the modal by users and show the results for advertiser by daily/hourly.

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

Technical 1: It didn’t go really well cause the guy was a total alphageek. I was able to solve the coding problem and the follow up but was not interested in looking at code at all. Kinda judged me for not knowing the technical term for prefix and suffix maximum sub array. The question was about sliding window.\nBest case scenario: Leaning hire\nWorst case scenario: Leaning no hire\n\n3. Technical 2: It went really well. The interviewer gave me biparite graph problem. I was able to answer all of her follow up questions and was able to provide her with an optimal solution. She really liked but she had a different solution in her head which was easier. She came to consensus with me that both her and my solution will provide the same time complexity. Couldn’t ask her any questions at the end as the time was up.\nBest case scenario: Hire\nWorst case scenario: Leaning hire\n\n3. Technical 3: The best out of all.

I was able to ask him a good question at the end.\nBest case scenario: Strong hire\nWorst case scenario: Hire \n\nSo what do you all think?

The question was not at all LC or DSA, and instead asked to design an API backend for file-searching, with support for recursive searching in sub-directories. I was completely thrown off but tried my best and asked questions based on what I was given. Didn't really solve it in the end, so overall didn't go so great.\n\n*Could only go uphill from here right?*\n\n**Round 2 (Bar Raiser?)**\n\nSecond one went much better, the interviewer had a shadow with him and asked a lot more LPs and I think I did fairly well. He gave me a DSA problem which I solved using sliding window. I felt the solution I gave was kinda brute force-y and was asked for a possibly more optimal solution but wasn't able to come up with anything. Overall, much better than the first interviewer.\n\n**Round 3 (Hiring Manager)**\n\nThis could not have possibly gone any better. The interviewer was great and spent a lot of time asking LPs, with follow-ups, and was really easy to talk to. He gave me a LRU Cache question in the last 20-mins and I was trying my best not to smile 'cause I'd just solved it the day before. I gave the brute force explanation and solved it in time using doubly linked lists with explanations.\n\nIt's been 4 days now and I was hoping to have heard back by Friday, but guess I'll have to wait till Monday. Hoping for an offer, I felt I did well in the last two rounds to make up for the first and feel I did well in my LPs too.

So, I thought I will be fast rejected by this round. 😇\n\n\n\nSecond round problem was OOP to build switchable cache class by user's choice. user can choose time-based or size-based cache limitation. For example, if user select time-based cache, remove all expired items after 5 min from input time. if user select size-based cache, when the size with new item is over limitation, remove any items to maintain the size <= limitation. Yeah, it was not too hard. But, I messed up because I didn't consider many edge cases like,  new\\_item\\_size > limitation. \n\n\n\nSystem design problem was about Amazon ads to update clicking numbers of the modal by users and show the results for advertiser by daily/hourly.

I clearly told her I had seen similar problems before, then walked through the approach, explained the logic, and wrote the code.\n\nBut during the dry run, I messed up a minor part of the logic — I miscalculated the area when flipping a water cell. It was a slip under pressure.\n\nSuddenly, she asked:\n\n“Did you really write this code yourself or did you copy it from somewhere?”\n\nI said no — I had practiced this type of problem before because I knew the company focuses on graph/matrix patterns, and that’s how I remembered the structure.

My timeline:\n\n* I finished my interview on July 3, 2025.\n* As of today, it’s been a full month, and my application status is still “application submitted”/“under review.”\n* Just yesterday, I got a reply from HR saying my application “is still under review.”\n* In my case, I had **only one interview round**.\n\nHere’s why I’m confused:\n\n* Several other candidates with the **same job ID and interviews around the same dates** had a second round, and a few even had a third round (including a Bar Raiser).\n* Some of them have also not received their results yet.\n* I haven’t received an offer, rejection, or waitlist mail yet.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. How long after the interview did it take you (or your batch) to receive the offer/rejection/waitlist result from Amazon—especially for SDE-I campus/bulk hiring?\n2. Is it possible to get an offer after just a single round, or do people usually need 2 or 3 rounds?\n3. Does having only 1 round mean a better chance, or is a second/third round more promising?\n4. Anyone else waiting more than a month for their result for this role/job ID?",

And those were:\n\n* DSA Round\n* Android Platform Round\n* Machine Coding Round (Android)\n* HM Round\n\nLet's go thorugh each and every round one by one-\n\n**DSA Round** \\- In this round I was asked 2 DSA questions. The time duration of this round was 1 hour only and I had to solve both the questions in that time limit only.\n\nThe first question was from Graphs topic and I must say that I am not very strong in Graphs and I was not expecting any Graphs question but it was my first question.\n\nQuestion was similar to : [https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/)\n\nLiterally I took a lot of time to firstly understand the problem then came to an unoptimised approach to which interviewer was not that happy.\n\nThen after 30 minutes he presented me another question.\n\nQuestion was: [https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)\n\nI solved this problem optimially before the given time limit and the interviewer was happy with my solution.\n\nI totally lost my hope for next round but luckily I got call from recruiter the next day for next round :)\n\n**Android Platform Round** \\- This round mainly revolved around basic android topics like ViewModel and its working, Activities, Fragments, Jetpack Compose.\n\nInterviewer mainly dig deeper on topics like Services and its usecases which I comfortably answered.\n\nThere was no question from his side which I was not able to answer correctly.\n\nGot a call from recruiter that I had cleared this round as well. Scheduled my next round the same day.\n\n**Machine Coding Round** \\- In this round I was given a problem to design a E-Commerce app and how will I be managing the data between different screens.\n\nThe data should also be synced with the backend servers.\n\nSO I basically was given some 4-5 criterias or features to complete in 90 minutes with scalable and clean code.\n\nI followed MVVM + Clean Architecture in Android for this round. Firstly I told my approach to the interviewer and discussed a bit on this part.\n\nThen when we were on same ground I started coding and I did it really fast as I had to complete all the features in the given time limit.\n\nI did exceptionally well in this round that interviewer even praised me at last.\n\nThen I got a call that I am eligible for HM Round. It was then scheduled for the next day.\n\n**HM Round** \\- In this round the Hiring Manager discussed about my experience at Inmobi-Glance and I told whatever I had done in my 1.5 years of FTE at Inmobi-Glance.\n\nThen he passed me an open ended question to design a map app and I had to tell him my approach in such a way that it is optimal and can be transformed into a market ready app with that approach.\n\nWe discussed a lot and then he asked some really tough behavioural questions to me which I answered confidently.\n\nI felt this round as the most difficult one.\n\n**Unexpected happened** : I was celebrating my farewell at my office (Inmobi-Glance) and I was pretty confident to get the offer that dat on May 30. Then HR called me and told me that there is a good and a bad news for me. I was shocked to hear this.\n\nHe told me that the collective feedback is mostly positive and they can consider me for an offer but I had to go through a **Bar-Raiser Round** due to my average performance in **DSA Round**\n\nI literally was weeping from inside and multiple thoughts were running in my mind like: \"May be they have found someone else that's why to reject me taking another round\" etc etc.\n\nBut still I somehow managed myself and I agreed to his request.\n\nThe fact was that I also did not have any laptop to prepare for this round as I had submitted my mac back to my organization (Inmobi-Glance).\n\nI borrowed a laptop from my friend and logged in my leetcode account and started preparing from next day.\n\n**Bar-Raiser Round** \\- In this round I was asked 2 questions. And this round I would say was the most easy round.\n\nThe first question was based on \"Min-Heap\" which I solved optimally.\n\nThe second question was based on some strings like some word and pattern problem. I solved this also optimally.\n\nThen that evening I got a call from recruiter that I had successfully cleared this round as well.\n\nThey were ready to give me an offer. And after 2-3 days I had my compensation call with my HM.\n\nThere we discussed my compensation.\n\nCompensation details: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6817292/phonepe-offer-software-development-engin-e294/](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6817292/phonepe-offer-software-development-engin-e294/)\n\nNow please help what should I choose at this point of time ?\n\nShareChat or PhonePe ?\n\nPlease help me.",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 New Grad -US Interview ( Stressed out about the final verdict)I recently completed my Amazon SDE-1 New Grad (US) interview process, on July 24 and I have been very stressed out how the final outcome would be. I’d really appreciate your suggestions or feedback on my experience.\n\nRound 1 : (Bar Raiser)\nIn the first round, I performed exceptionally well. I engaged with the interviewer throughout the conversation and provided lengthy, well-structured responses using the STAR format and standard interviewing techniques. The interviewer was genuinely intrigued by some of my projects and went deep into the details during follow-ups. I believe I did well in this round. I even asked a few impressive questions to the interviewer and expressed my enthusiasm for joining Amazon. I also mentioned how comfortable I felt throughout the interview process.\n\nRound 2: (LP+ LLD)\nIn the second round, I was asked to present a project and discuss its technical aspects. I presented my project well and answered the interviewer’s questions thoroughly. I felt confident in my abilities and believed I had done well in this round as well.\nSimilar to the previous rounds, my LPs performed exceptionally well. I even came up with unique stories for different projects, different from the I used in Round 1. The interviewers were impressed by the research-based projects and decisions I made in my past endeavors. One of the interviewers posed technical questions about my projects, and I responded with a well-structured STAR format. Overall, my LP was good.\n\nThen comes the LLD, which seems to be a very small task and not something I’ve seen anywhere before. I started by listing out all the requirements and key features, then came up with solutions. I designed my drafted version, explained what I had done, and then gave a modified and better version of my modules based on the frequently changing requirements. I feel like I’ve done what I’ve been asked, except the design isn’t in OOD format because the task wasn’t in that format. Then, the Shadow asked me to identify the bugs and mentioned that there’s an edge case missing in it. I debugged my code but couldn’t find that edge case. I had mixed feelings for this round for my LLD. However, I feel like I’ve been actively communicating and keeping track of the requirements while coding it.\n\nRound 3 (Technical):\nDirectly jumped into the DSA and gave me two modified Leetcode-style questions.\n\nQuestion 1: It’s a variant of the Top k frequent items in a list problem, but with various edge cases and string manipulations involved. I gave my brute force approach and explained why it’s not a good solution. Then, I presented the hash map-based approach with two possible solutions: sorting by values or using a heap. I analyzed the complexities of both approaches. I implemented a fully working code, and the interviewer gave a small follow-up. I fixed my code to that change. Overall, he seemed satisfied.\n\nQuestion 2: With only 25 minutes left, the interviewer asked me to explain the solution while coding. It was a challenging LC graph question. I quickly came up with a solution because it was a combination of graph traversal and backtracking. I explained the question and started coding while talking. My pseudocode was fully executable and easy to understand. He asked me to explain the solution using the test case, and I explained the code. I quickly ran through the test case and gave the solution. I accidentally made the question a bit harder while asking the interviewer about the requirements, and my solution worked for it. Overall, he seemed satisfied with my approach. However, I made a mistake when he asked about the complexity of my code. I wasn’t entirely sure about it. But what I said was right when I checked after the interview. He then asked some follow-up questions about my approach and other technical questions related to it, and I answered them well. I feel confident about my performance in this round.\n\nI’m so stressed out about my final verdict. Based on your experiences, how would you rate this interview? Am I having a chance?\n\nEDIT : I got rejection today. I’m totally devastated after this decision, even after doing my best and performing well. At this point, I don’t even understand what they’re even looking in a New Grad. Anyway, thanks for all your support and reaching out. Good luck with your Job hunt!!",

It is on my agenda to learn and practice but at a slow pace.\n\nJust a few minutes ago, I received an OA invitation from Amazon for a \"Fungible SDEI Intern\" position. I have 15 days from today to prepare. I am overwhelmed and do not know where and how to start. I have never practiced online nor tried to solve problems using data structures and algorithms. So, I lack the \"problem-solving\" mindset to analyze and address the problems I see. I know that it is mainly about recognizing the pattern of the problem and then projecting this pattern on some algorithms along with data structure to use.\n\nSo, I am familiar with the following (Familiar means I know the concept but never practiced):\n\n\\- Basic Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, graphs (kindaaa of!)\n\n\\- Algorithms: some sorting algorithms, search algorithms, Dynamic programming, basics of recursion (I try to avoid this at all costs TBH!), \n\n  \nAt this point, given these 15 days available, my questions will be:\n\n1) Do I need to learn the theoretical background of every algorithm (I do NOT mean proofs, but the notions of how the algorithm works)? Or just practicing is sufficient?\n\n2) What topics should I tackle and how? TBH the roadmap in my head is very messy. If you ask me to sit and work, I would not know what to do first or where to start.\n\n3) I understand that there are problems to solve for free on Leetcode. Are these enough? Or do I have to pay for the full account? If I cannot afford the premium account, what other websites I can use to practice that you recommend in my case?\n\n4) If you feel like you wanna give me a tip/advice, you are most welcome :)\n\n  \nThank you!",

    "raw": "Chance of passing the phone screen interview E4 MetaI had an interview for Software Engineer E4 position (US based) a few days ago. There are two medium LC questions (both appeared in top Meta tagged question in LC 30 days). \n\nFor the first question, I implemented well  but not too optimal solution ( my code took O (k logn) time complexity with O(n) space complexity, instead of  a solution with O(n log k) time complexity + O(k) and could not come up with O(n) solution which was very hard to think of under 1 min). Also one small bug here is that I used nums = heapq.heapify(nums), where heapify is in place operation. The interviewer did not point it out.\n\nFor the second problem, which is a bit harder, I implemented well bug free, asked lot of edge cases about the constraints, any assumptions before going to  the solution. The interviewer sometimes said those are good questions. I felt the interviewer did not follow my explanation (probably my English is not too good), but after implementing I explained by a dry run. The codes are correct (after checking with GPT), optimally. I answered pretty okay follow up questions.\n\n  \nWhat is my chance to go to onsite/loop round ? ",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 2 Onsite Loop Experience + Resources (Result: Rejection)Hi folks, thought I'd chip in with my own experience from my onsite this month. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBackground: I'm a SWE with 4 YOE working at one of the big, well-known tech companies. Admittedly, Amazon was not a top choice for me to move to but I wanted to test the waters as I hit my on-hire RSUs cliff at my current company so compensation would no doubt be higher at Amazon. I also felt rusty interview-wise so I figured it'd be great experience/practice. Ahead of the interview, I mostly focused on LPs and system design as I was fairly confident with the coding part (I've been consistently doing Leetcode for a while now). I also used ChatGPT (the advanced voice feature) to mock my LP interviews and get real-time feedback (I'd recommend it). I did look up some posts regarding LLD (low-level design) just to get an idea of what they might ask, but didn't prepare much for this as I felt like I had a solid grasp on the fundamentals for OOD (object-oriented design). I shared some links for some resources that I used at the bottom of the post FYI.\n\nRound 1 - Coding + 2 LPs:\n\nLPs were straightforward, they asked me some follow-ups which I was able to answer quickly. Interviewer seemed satisfied overall. The coding question was a graph problem and if you're comfortable with DFS and BFS you'd nail the problem. Follow-up was pretty straightforward too, essentially adding a \"cost\" element to edges in the nodes. Interestingly, interviewer explicitly mentioned after they shared the follow-up that they didn't want me to code it up, just discuss. We had a good amount of time at the end for questions and it was a super-friendly/casual conversation. Felt like a solid hire signal to me.\n\nRound 2 - LLD + 2 LPs\n\nSame as above, LPs went smoothly and follow-ups were pretty basic questions. Won't dive into the exact question, but if you're able to solve the [Amazon Locker LLD question](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/) you'd be able to solve the one I got. I made sure to keep extensibility in mind as I defined interfaces and base classes that would later be extended. There weren't any \"gotchas\", it's pretty straightforward and as long you come up with a clean design you should be good. Just keep extensibility in mind and you should be prepared for the follow-ups (which just add requirements/scope to the original problem). Overall, felt like this was also a hire signal.\n\nRound 3 - Coding + 2 LPs\n\nThis interviewer was definitely more inquisitive about my LP answers, asking a lot more follow-ups and clarifications than the previous two (not in a bad way, they just asked a lot of questions as they likely just wanted to get enough context). For coding it was another graph question, well-known LC problem. Again, if you know how to implement DFS and BFS in your language of choice you'd be fine. Had to convince the interviewer on some aspects of correctness of my algorithm, but overall they seemed satisifed by the end. Finished ahead of time and spent the remaining time speaking casually about work, culture, and some other stuff. If they weren't convinced of my LPs, this could be a lean hire but overall felt like it was a hire.\n\nRound 4 - Hiring Manager (System Design + 2 LPs)\n\nI'd imagine this is the interview that ultimately sunk my chances. LPs started off well, but I got the impression the HM wasn't particularly impressed with my stories. Admittedly, one of his questions did throw me off a bit as I didn't have a written down story for it so had to think of something on the spot and improvise. They also asked me to summarize my story a bit further, as I probably was talking too much on the \"situation\" aspect of my story. Going into the system design, it was basically a problem with pretty simple functional requirements but in the context of a very high burst of volume of requests. I followed the [HelloInterview framework](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery) and was able to spend most of the time talking about the interesting part of the problem (bursty traffic) in the deep-dive. Overall, it didn't feel great, as despite feeling good about my choices and mentioning tradeoffs throughout the design the interviewer just didn't seem receptive. It felt more like a presentation than an interview, with the HM mostly being quiet.\n\nResult: Received a rejection after exactly 5 business days - wasn't provided any info regarding cool-off period in regards to re-applying.\n\nSome thoughts: You'll notice I didn't have a bar-raiser round, as most of the engineers (apart from HM) who interviewed me were below senior (maybe one was senior?). Not sure why, I guess it's probably team-dependent. Overall, right after the interviews I felt good about my chances but still had some doubts due to the HM interview. My guess is that the Amazon HM wasn't impressed during the interview (I'd lean more because of the LPs as I had done system design mocks and got positive feedback and Amazon's system design question felt easier than the mocks). It's of course also possible I got out-performed by another candidate or maybe even one of the interviews I thought went well actually didn't. You never know, right? Definitely feels like the bar is much higher than four years ago. As many other commenters have mentioned on this subreddit before, it's best to assume you got rejected right after your interview. At least then you won't be disappointed either way! :)\n\nResources I used:\n\n* [https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176](https://medium.com/@bhargavacharanreddy/amazon-sde-2-l5-interview-experience-and-tips-resources-for-interview-prep-9e7602c32176)\n* [https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/](https://techmockinterview.com/blog/2022/08/12/logical-and-maintainable-coding-interview-amazon-locker/)",

Just finished 2 hours ago:\n\n* Day 1 - Behavioral\n   *  I fucking rocked this one. I gave a lot of depth to my stories for every occurrence that he asked for and I was able to cover wide breadth at E5. Scope. He even said, in two of the questions \"I had follow up questions for you but you ansewerd them already so we will skip those\".

The interviewer pointed it out and I fixed it \n   * Next was asked this [one](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k). \n   * I correctly Identified that negative numbers would exist in the array\n   * Spent a lot of time verifying and trying to justify my solution, which I kind of got to work\n   * Just couldn't squeeze a solution into my mind. I started going down one path and realized it wouldn't work, so I backtracked.\n   * Started talking my way through another solution, which I realized wouldn't work \n   * She gave me a hint (that I didn't use) and instead I immediately thought up of the correct solution, coded it up. She called out an edge case and I coded it up to fix it. Explained the S/T Complexity\n* Day 2 Product Architecture\n   * I thought I was prepared 😢 my last few E5 SD mocks went so well I went into this confident.\n   * System design problem was LC Contest.\n   * Start and my interviewer throws a lot of requirements at me which I think I get through. I start talking about non functional requirements, and he really drives deeply into every single thing that I say/giving me hints that I don't think I was getting\n   * Same thing with API. I can't hand wave anything or say \"Let's come back to this\", he dives into a lot of stuff. My mocks were so different where they generally let me complete things to 90% and I could move on.\n   * At this point I'm like 22 mins and and I don't even have the high level design started so I know it's a reject.

There are two medium LC questions (both appeared in top Meta tagged question in LC 30 days). \n\nFor the first question, I implemented well  but not too optimal solution ( my code took O (k logn) time complexity with O(n) space complexity, instead of  a solution with O(n log k) time complexity + O(k) and could not come up with O(n) solution which was very hard to think of under 1 min). Also one small bug here is that I used nums = heapq.heapify(nums), where heapify is in place operation. The interviewer did not point it out.\n\nFor the second problem, which is a bit harder, I implemented well bug free, asked lot of edge cases about the constraints, any assumptions before going to  the solution. The interviewer sometimes said those are good questions. I felt the interviewer did not follow my explanation (probably my English is not too good), but after implementing I explained by a dry run.

Camera on. Interviewer connected. Amazon Chime died as soon as I had a glimpse of my interviewer's face. This happened twice. **Chime sucks balls.** I've got a laptop with excellent specs. Anyways, the interviewer said it's fine if the video isn't on. Sigh of relief. Introduces himself. **His English sucks**. He's Czech, I think, so no problem with the bad English on a personal level, but it was not ideal. English is not my first language either, but I'm fluent. Anyways, I think I answered the behavioral questions well in terms of content and format, but due to this English disparity, especially with my slight but definitely present Asian accent and his heavy Central European accent, I **had to repeat things more than a few times.** (I feel terrible for pissing on his English, but it was a very genuine problem for me.)\n\nAt this stage the interview was not a total disaster, but not looking very good. The coding round was where things got real weird. A **single question and it was not LeetCode**. Will not go into the specifics, but after a rapid round of Q&A with the interviewer, it boiled down to **initializing a datatype, sorting a list based on said datatype, and splicing the list.** I use Python, so, the final code ended up being like 13 lines long?  He asked me the **time complexities of the two functions** I created, some **basic questions about the datatyp**e I used (it was an existing datatype so easy), and then, the big question was... **how would I test the code**. Now, unit tests are a thing that I would use, but I have no idea how to write one. So instead, I just explained what I would do. Things like use a database which has both the raw data and the results we should get upon processing, run the raw data through the code and compare the results, and then for the sorted part, a for loop through the list to check if the value of each element is less than the preceding element. For the splicing, just... check the length of the returned list against the input given. He was like, okay, that's good, I think we're done with this.\n\nThen he asked me if I had any questions, and this is the part I felt went the best. I asked a few questions about what he said he's doing, in some detail, as it's in ML and I know stuff in that field. He almost seemed excited to talk about it. The interview ended on a good note, and I asked if we could connect on LinkedIn, and he said, I'll have to ask if there's a company policy on this, but feel free to find me and send a request (which I did soon after). He also told me to expect an answer within 5 days, as mentioned in the mail and on [amazon.jobs](https://amazon.jobs). \n\n**SO. Can anyone tell me how did this interview actually go? I think it went well, for the conditions I was in, but could this lead to an offer or it's gonna be a no? Opinions and advice, welcome.**\n\n**Also. This coding without LeetCode? Is this a thing? How many of you have gotten questions like this? Does this happen usually? Could Amazon be deploying a new hiring strategy? Opinions on this too.**",

He asked me two behavioral questions which I already prepared for so that part is good (\\~10mins). And then he gave me the first coding problem. I touched upon the brute force solution with runtime and then tried to come up with a DP solution. I tried to explain to him but he seems confused even though I'm sure mine solution was right. And then he said, let's move on to the second question. The second one is easier so it was straightforward and I think he understands what I was doing. After that, he asked another question about if I can write a single solution for both problem (they quite similar) and then I assume there is one so I tried so hard but couldn't think of anything. He was smiling seeing me struggle and then I asked him to give me a hint. Turns out it's impossible to do so and we had like a good discussion about it so. And then, he came back to first question and asked me again how did I come up with the DP, and I tried to explain to him again but he's still confused so I offered to walk through an example. However, we already spent an hour at that time (interview supposed to be 45') so he said we do not have enough time. And then he asked if I have questions for him. I asked him two questions and seem like he liked the questions because he asked the same question before when he applied. And then, we ended the call and he said: \"THe HR team will get back to you for next steps\". I think I fumbled the first question cuz he didn't understand my explanation but Im pretty my solution is right.\n\nIt has been two days and haven't heard back and freaking out rn....",

Want to share my experience with DRW interviewing as a UI engineer.\n\n**My background**\n\nI've done a LOT of full-stack work, and a LOT of front-end. Probably over 400 hours in react, both in industry projects and my own. 200 of those hours are in NextJS, pages router and app router. And, all 400 hours in typescript. I know my way around these pieces of technology like the back of my hand.\n\n**OA (Passed)**\n\nGave a really simple question to modify a very basic react component. Required you to know the basics HTML elements, specifically the label and input elements, how to forward refs, etc\n\nQuestions 2 and 3 were LC easy/mediums.\n\n**45-min Technical Phone Screen (Rejeected)**\n\n45 minutes of Q&A type interview. DRW probably spent about 15 minutes on real-application experience, like the high level stuff about how react works, typings (unions, discriminated, etc etc ) nothing crazy.\n\nThe last 30 minutes of the interview were very technical. I was asked to talk about how Javascript worked under hood -- things like the event loop, and memory leaks in react. You were expected to know how async works under the hood as well (microtask queue, macrotask queue, call stack, memory heap, etc). I actually knew most oddly technical questions but did not know many of them by name because I had spent most of my time building as opposed to drowning in the documentation.\n\nI should also add 15 of those last 30 minutes were set aside for python. Is python static/dynamically typed, scoping (which is lexical), decorators, etc, which I got most of these things right.\n\nI was rejected 2 days after the interview.\n\n**My Consensus**\n\nI obviously have no hard feelings about not passing, despite my past background. DRW seemed to be filtering through a \"drowned-in-the-docs\" type of nerd, versus a \"build-fast build-hard\" nerd.\n\nFor me personally, I don't believe in the \"drowned-in-the-docs\" mentality, so both DRW and I would not have been a good fit regardless. (this does not mean I don't believe in writing good code. I know what is good code vs bad code, according to documentation)\n\nMost of what they asked about (e.g. technical stuff) I've almost never had to even think about during development -- and for good reason. JavaScript is designed in a way where you don't necessarily have to understand the inner workings, as long as you understand the implementation and how to implement properly according to the docs.\n\nBest of luck to anyone out there getting this call!

Whole screening was scheduled for 30 mins and first 10 was behaviour/resume questions so essentially was given 20 mins.\n\nQuestion: Design a reminder system where user will send request with some json data and timestamp in future and when timestamp is met reminder system will notify user. I did ask the question how will we expect the reminder system to  notify user and was told that it depends on how you design the system.\n\nI basically designed this as :\n\n1. Reminder class with id, timestamp and data,\n2. ReminderSystem class which initiates a fake DB as list to store reminders and two functions one to create_reminder and second to check_upcoming_reminders.\n3. Finally for main function, initiate ReminderSystem object and user will call create_reminder function and add a reminder in the fake DB list\n4. Then a while loop which keep calling check_upcoming_reminders function and inside this  function i check if each reminder timestamp is equal to current time, if true then return the json data associated to that reminder. \n\nPossible reasons i think it went bad:\n\n1. I initially got bit lost with the question it seemed very open ended, After some initial questions i went on to coding the solution without explaining my approach and honestly i wasn’t sure about my approach either but mid way i kind of figured out how can i bring this together in whatever time i had left. \n2. My whole approach to design this question was wrong. What could’ve been the better approach \n3. There were few typos in the code. Example: typo in datetime library and single = sign instead of double to compare in an if statement. \n\nCan you please provide some feedback on my experience here, it would really help me improve.

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad Final Round Interview 3/4Hello! I just finished my interview yesterday on Friday.\n\nI got 2 coding rounds and 1 system design round.\n\nI was able to solve both problems with optimal solutions. I am a little concerned though.\n\nFor the first round, I did not know that I needed to initialize my static pointers to NULL. However, he was really nice about it and said that he is just super experienced in C++ and so that's how he caught it. Either than that, there was not a problem during that round.\n\nFor the second round, there was a lot of technical difficulties and I got kinda nervous about the time. In the problem I needed to do, I need to reverse a linked list. Reversing the linked list was just a subproblem but I totally blanked out and could not for the life of me think of it. The interviewer told me to just assume there is a reverse function for linked lists. After that, I came up with an optimal solution to the problem.\n\nMy last round was system design round and I think the bar raiser. He said I did really good on the round.\n\nI'm not sure of my chances though.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the chance of me getting the offer! I expect the results to be out Tuesday or Thursday as typically stated on this sub.\n\nEDIT:\nFound out this morning at 9:10 AM\n\n3/7 8:21 PM: Moved to another Job\n\n3/8 12:30 PM: Offer came in and accepted",

Just seemed like talking to a cool guy and didn't feel pressure. We talked about college and cs in general, talked about where we think tech is going, AI, etc.\n* We started talking about chatgpt and he began delving more into the role, explained that GPT is expected to be used to check our code before we relay it to them.\n* Almost out of nowhere, he asked if I had the paid GPT-4, and I said yes, and he asked me to share my screen for a little exercise. Was caught off guard because recruiter didn't mention there would be a technical component\n* I started getting pretty nervous but really he just wanted to see how i'd approach an issue. He sent me a block of code and showed me in his local environment an example of a bug on their site. He asked me how I would approach this and he had me diagnose the issue in front of him to present three possible solutions.\n* He seemed really interested in how I wrote prompts for GPT. I was playing it safe the first couple times and he urged me to just pretend he wasn't there. I did eventually ease up and gave him what i thought were the top three solutions.\n* He asked me why I didn't choose another possible solution and wanted me to justify\n* After all of this it went back to being casual and he thanked me for being a good sport. We chatted a little bit longer and I got to ask some questions. Then he said the recruiter would be in touch. I have a call scheduled with the recruiter this week\n* After the interview finished I felt like I didn't do that great, but the recruiter emailed me the next day and said she got good feedback. Don't know yet whether i made it to final but I'm trying to be hopeful\n\nI'm really curious about if anyone has done a third/final interview with them and what that entails.

I started to believe this too and thought there was little chance of me getting a job (May grad). Of course these are good things to do and have, but I think it gets exaggerated on here.   \n\nI went to a recruiting event at my college and ended up having a really good conversation with a recruiter for the company. I sent my application in, took my OA, and then did the phone screen which led to the technical interview. I studied the questions posted on Glassdoor, but ended up getting a different coding question. I answered all the OOP based questions well and had a really good talk with the interviewer. For the coding question, I didn’t pass a single test case and was going back to fix my code when he stopped me. He told me that he was actually just looking to see my thought process and how I went about solving it and that I was on the right track. Anyone I asked told me that since I got the question wrong I was cut and someone even told me I should be embarrassed I didn’t get it.    \n\nAnyways, I end up getting moved to the final round which is supposedly behavioral. Well, they pull out another coding question haha. I did better on this one, but ultimately didn’t quite get it in time. We actually talked through it after he stopped me and I was correct, just had a couple things out of order. Once again, this interviewer also told me that the main thing was my communication skills and thought process. \n\nA week later I received an offer and this is the company I have wanted to work at since I started college. From reading here and Discord, I had multiple people tell me that there is no shot, so I was really surprised because I had started to believe them lol. They said that they really enjoyed how I went about the problems and communicated clearly. My point in posting this is not to brag or anything close. To the people that feel they have no hope because of internships, LC, or whatever it is - this isn’t true! I don’t see as many people on here talk about the importance of communicating and having good conversation during the interviews. In my head, I was thinking either way I want to have learned something from the devs that interview me and this lead to good vibes during the interview.     \n\nKeep working to get internships and grinding LC, but do not think you are totally screwed and will never get a job otherwise.

A recruiter for one of the companies (not particularly a dream company, just a random company I saw that was hiring) calls up and asks for general info. Everything is pretty standard until he asks for desired hourly rate and I said 45$.\n\nThe reasoning was that my internship paid that amount and I live in a high cost of living area so I thought this was a reasonable rate since this job would pretty much be in the same area (about 1 hour away from where I live).\n\nThe recruiter laughed out loud and said \"Are you serious? You know this is your first actual job?\". Then I replied with my reasoning I said above and he said \"This is not an internship, this is real life\". However, I would think an actual job would pay as much, if not more than an internship, no?\n\nAnyways, I asked to withdraw from consideration from the job because I didn't really like the tone of his response and I genuinely thought that the rate I gave was reasonable and I wasn't trying to \"high ball\" my rate.

People were also rightfully and openly upset about the lack of bonuses and salary freezes.\n\nMost of the other interns I knew (we were at a smaller satellite office) were working probably 60 hours a week near the end of the internship. Some of the friends I made were going into the office on Saturday AND Sunday. I really didn’t want work to comprise of 80% of my waking hours so I just phoned it in instead of burning out completely for the last couple weeks. I didn’t get a return offer and neither did any of the others that I knew of, which was pretty shitty in my opinion.\n\nI know things aren’t amazing in the tech industry but this gave me a bad impression of FAANG, I didn’t even bother asking for an internship return offer lmfao.

I didn't know a thing about it but since I did apply here and wasn't hearing back from anywhere I applied, I decided to go. Spent the whole night and the time before the interview to learn concepts, which tools are used and the purpose behind them in DevOps. I made a mistake to not go through the basic programming concepts. Coming on to the interview, the interviewer asked me to mention the pillars of  OOP and I just froze there because I couldn't remember them. I told him that I use these concepts in my day to day life but I couldn't remember which concept meant which term. Naturally, he wasn't amused. He then asked me some technical terms that I had never heard in my life to which I answered that I didn't know. After a few more questions, he asked me to answer a trick question. I got it wrong and couldn't figure it out. In the end, he basically said that for a guy in his last year , I have poor programming concepts and have a low IQ because I couldn't solve his trick question( this made me really furious).

    "raw": "Palantir Interview Prep (Intern & New Grad) + Rejection copeHello person looking for how to prep for a Palantir interview! Congrats on getting here, your mental toil has just begun!\n\nI got all the way to the final round (hiring manager) just to be rejected for god knows why (they won't ever tell you because they ghost after). So now out of anger and sadness, I hope I can help out those of you in the future to prepare for this 5 round process.\n\nInterview 1: Recruiter Call\n\nThere is nothing very deep about this one, you just need to suck up to them and say how much you find the company and culture interesting and appealing. Talk about your experience and how it can relate to the work they do. I was told during this call that I'll be moving forward and I've heard that this is generally the case, so if you don't get told that your chances might be slim.\n\nInterview 2: First technical coding interview\n\nThey used to use a third party for this but now they get their engineers to do it which I guess is better? It's just 1 question (in my case at least) set for 45 mins and was comparable to a leetcode medium. Practice with [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice) do as much as you can to get comfortable with all basic algo concepts and you should be fine. Here is a list of most frequently asked Palantir questions on leetcode too. I didn't get asked any of these questions during this round however, so this list is not all that they could ask. Be on your toes for this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jvw7wxexpsc1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a196ba619605ba35192af28bcb24c946d91f925\n\n \n\nInterview 3 + 4: Learning & Decomposition\n\nyes sir 2 interviews back to back! I was applying for London while in the states so I had to wake up early in the AM for this one. HAHA all that to get fucking rejected FUNNNNNN.\n\nAnyway, decomposition is purely just a system design question. But it won't be something like design an existing application. The question is much more vague and you should go over a couple possible design choices, explore each of them talking about their pros and cons then dive into one design. Question could be like: We want to make taxi driver's lives easier. We have data about 8000 of their routes. What could we do? As long as you know basic system design concepts and practices you should be golden. Here are some resources: Grokking system design is always good, I also found this guy on YouTube who does some really good videos for it too: [https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163)\n\nLearning is something unique. You cannot prepare for this what so ever in all honesty. They literally teach you a library, concept, or something of that sort and you have to use that new knowledge. In my case it was a concept, I was taught what it was and how it worked, given a function that did said concept + some documentation. I was then shown code, asked to explain what it did, then told to improve its efficiency. Overall this is probably the easiest of the three in my opinion. You can ask the interviewer as many questions as you want for clarification (which is a good thing) and then use your own problem solving skills to complete it. Be confident in yourself and you should be fine.\n\nAlso to mention, both of these rounds are 1h each, 15 mins first dedicated to behavioral then the actual interview.\n\nInterview 5 (Final): Hiring Manager (senior engineering manager)\n\nWelcome, to the final round. You should feel good about making it this far. I sure did... of course that all went away just as quick. This is a 1 hour interview. Supposed to be split roughly half behavioral, half technical. The technical can be literally whatever the hiring manager wants. It is said for many to be a repeat of the worst of your previous three interviews so either coding, decomp or learning again. Majority of them tend to be coding. Now for me it was coding. My question was from the leetcode list above which was great and made me feel more confident (ha like it helped) but its not always the case. I've heard its common to get more of a Data structure design question like LRU cache compared to algo design. So be prepared for that. People say for the behavioral they really grill you on both resume and why you want to work there. What your desired future career looks like and other questions of that sort. Its supposed to let you talk about your interests with the manager. My guy just looked and sounded pretty uninterested which made me worry (rightfully so). My behavioral was only 20 mins (on the dot btw) so yeah... I've heard that for others (who actually got the job) their behavioral was longer like 40 mins. For some they don't even have a technical too! But how long your behavioral is does not dictate success either. There is a guy who got to final round twice, both of which were only behavioral, and got rejected twice.... I believe if the manager seems more engaged its a good sign?\n\nI personally thought my hiring manager round was the best interview out of all of them. I had answers to every question, tried to engage in more of a conversational manner, aced the coding. Idk maybe I'm missing something but I shall never know!\n\nWell hopefully this info helped. I pray luck is on your side unlike it was for me. If you get rejected join the squad, we got tissues and alcohol. If you get accepted, Congratulations! I am so proud of you, and please refer me later thanks.",

Got 2-3 OA/ 1-2 initial HR interviews, but nothing to exciting, and no replies afterwards.\n\nThen Apple reached out to me for an SWE internship position which I applied 3-4 months back. In the job description it had listed both phd and masters are encouraged to apply. After getting ghosted for 10 days, rescheduling twice, I managed to do the interview.\n\nI had no idea what was going to be asked, as this is not a typical swe job, it is regarding a specific field. So I practised some leet code, but also studied/learned more about the position specific technology, strengthened my overall therotical background for that area.\n\nMy interview had no leetcode and only technical high level discussion about the specific area of research/tech with the team lead. And the interview that was supposed to last 30 minutes actually went over for 50 minutes. Thanks to my studies I had really good understanding of the field and I was able to answer all of the questions, and got pretty good feedback. Actually past 30 minute mark I was praying for interview to be over because I thought I was killing it, and didnt want to ruin my chances with a concept I didnt know.\n\nInterviewer was actually surprised that I knew some of the stuff he/she asked because it is not something that would be taught in masters. It was a pleasant discussion and although extremely nervous I had fun thinking/coming up with solutions to questions.\n\nI am just extremely happy that I actually manage to do an interview! I am just genuinely happy that I know someone read my CV, reached out to me and dedicated a time for interview. There is just something relieving about getting the recognition you need, even its just an interview. \n\nIt is extremely hard to get interviews at these big tech companies, but I dont think that means that you're unqualified. I thought I was not good enough, but my perception just changed with an interview invite. \n\nI know that cs job market is kind of though for new grads right now, but don't lose your confidence or hope. \n\nLast note, I don't believe I'll get the job because its \"Apple\", and there will be more competitive PhD students that outweight me with their higher level of education, but still I am hopeful, and this experience helped me get my confidence back.

I just wanted to share my experience with job hunting since my experience may help those who are currently seeking or who are about to seek full-time opportunities. First, I just wanted to bring up my background to you so you know how difficult the process is even with internships on resume. I have 2 swe internships and I applied to 380ish apps total in a span of 7-8 months. Out of the 380ish apps, I have gotten 3 interviews in total that were swe and 2 that were consulting/associate program. I personally applied everywhere across the country that had new grad roles that were swe. I was able to land an offer that pays a rather a great TC in Chicago for new grad at non-tech company. I did not have to leetcode at all and the technical interview was based on system design assignment. For those who think you need leetcode to get a job as swe is out of touch with reality. I have gotten OA's that were coding questions but not leetcode at all where I was tested with fundamentals of CS and logic coding problems. I do believe that practicing for leetcode is important since it enhances your skill with problem solving and deeper understanding of the programming language you practice with. I suggest those who are jub hunting or about to job hunt for ft roles to not stress about leetcode. You are better off doing 1 problem a day than having to grind 10 questions a day. I honestly spent so much time doing leetcode and I felt like the time was wasted aimlessly doing puzzles when I could've spent that time doing projects or schoolwork. If you are going for faang companies, then I agree that LC is necessary but for non-fang companies you are better off spending your time building personal projects and reviewing cs concepts than having to lc grind.",

I found I had the best performance when I didn't care about the outcome at all\n   * speaking on non technical things in behavioral's I think really helps to vibe with your interviewer and spark interest in you\n* there is absolutely no shame in failing an interview, it's always a learning process and dwelling on it  hurt me long term. no particular company is a must over the hundreds that are hiring\n   * getting rejected after a final interview that seems to goes well will always hurt tho :((\n   * i think this is in part due to really selective companies needing more than just passing all the technicals, they need to like you in particular which comes a lot through your behavioral interview and resume\n* smaller companies often have room for salary negotiation, especially with competing offers\n\ni think that's it from me, there is still so much time left for us new grads next summer, so don't lose hope! happy to answer any questions.",

    "raw": "a pleb's experience looking for an internshipGather around all, I've been fortunate enough to be able to sign an offer with a random non-tech company this week. But the full path to it is something worth sharing (I think).\n\n**About Me:**\n\nSecond year at UCLA studying a math-related major, 5'8\", 155 bench/245 squat/255 dl (pre-quarantine, rip gains), plat4 NA TFT loool\n\n**Summary of Resume**\n\n3.7 gpa with data structures and computer organization as relevant cs courses, research exp with grad student in stats, 1 full stack app, 2 tech-ish positions I held during high school at a local government agency, and a statistics related club with a small project completed.\n\n**Prefacing**\n\nI actually got a B- my first quarter in the intro to cs course so I was feeling pretty discouraged. Thankfully I got my shit together and improved a lot and regained some confidence in my skills.\n\n**Before actually applying**\n\nThe title is actually kind of not 100% true because I continued to do this while applying but I mostly did this before I applied anywhere. I practiced my dsa skills with LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview. I would usually read through sections of CTCI then do some problems in the book and then do some LeetCode problems related to the topics I just studied. I mainly focused on the core data structures in CTCI and did not pay much attention to the more advanced topics (AVL, Red Black trees etc.) After reviewing all my data structures, I practiced by selecting random LeetCode problems to recognize what data structure are good for different types of problems. I noticed that I sometimes struggle on implementation type problems. To remedy this, I did some problems from previous CodeForces Div 2 contests. I focused on problems A/B mostly because those problems generally focus more on pure implementation. By the end of the summer, I solved **134** LeetCode Problems (65 Easy/63 Medium/6 Hard) and maybe \\~20–30 CodeForces problems. The other thing I did was to update and spruce up my resume. What helped me a lot was getting my resume read by my upperclassmen friends/career counselors at school. It also helps to attend a resume workshop hosted to get an idea of how you should write things on your resume.\n\n**Applying**\n\nI started applying on August 27th. I cast a wide net for places I was willing to work at. My only real criteria for applying was that the position was paid. I’d get automated responses requesting for OAs (Online Assessments) or HireVues. OAs were a hit or miss but I felt that OAs let me know where my weak points were. HireVues were annoying but it definitely helped me prepare for answering behavioral questions. Notice I said automated responses, I don’t think I talked to a real recruiter until October. I’m not going to lie, it was kind of degrading to send out a slew of applications only to be ghosted or rejected. However, the only thing I could do was to keep applying and fix any weak spots in my resume. In the end, I sent out a total of **317** applications. I received referrals to 5 companies and all 5 of them ghosted/rejected me. Here's a nice [snakey diagram](https://i.imgur.com/FR1s31L.png) summarizing everything.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nThankfully, I had opportunities to interview come mid October. To prepare, I did a couple mock interviews to get used to broadcasting my thoughts while solving problems. I also reviewed my projects, resume, and OOP concepts, to be able to talk about them in depth. Finally, I read the section of CTCI on the behavioral interview and rehearsed some answers. I interviewed at three (non-tech) companies, two of them had a technical portion, and all of them had behavioral portions. I would personally classify them all as LeetCode easy questions. \n\n**Aftermath**\n\nI was fortunate enough to have receive two offers, one from a company related to education that I've personally never heard of and one from a large insurance company. I signed with the education related company because the engineers that interviewed me made it sound like it was a better place to work at (and TC is slightly higher har har).\n\n**Some Reflection**\n\nThe shotgunning a ton of applications was a little depressing to me because most of these companies ended up ghosting/rejecting me. I think it goes without saying that rejection stings even after 100, 200, 300 applications. But, the only thing I that kept me going was the hope that one recruiter will think I'm hot shit. For interviewing it was actually both exciting that I had an opportunity and frighteningly nerve wracking considering the abysmal response rate that I have. One thing that seemed to help me was to listen to some incredibly toxic music (Future) so I become incredibly toxic (jk) and confident. Then I take some deep breaths and turn up my charisma and charm to a 100 and kill the interview before my social anxiety cripples me in time for Zoom class where I mute myself and turn off my webcam (not really but you get the idea). Another interesting thing is that I thought not being a cs major would be a disadvantage but apparently some people just really liked to talk about math lol. I felt that the Leetcode that I've done was a little overkill considering the technical questions were \"easy\" but it's whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that sums up everything I have to say, GLGL to everyone still searching u can do it :-)",

    "raw": "Awful FAANG Internship Experience, Worried about FT OfferHi all, I’m currently an intern at a FAANG (yes, that one). I’m almost six weeks in and I’ve been absolutely miserable so far. My team is all really nice, but I’m the first intern my manager has ever had, and the scope of my project is so open-ended (and uninteresting to me) that I’ve struggled to make progress so far. I’m also in a brand new city where I don’t know anyone, which hasn’t helped matters either, and my team is fully remote which means it’s hard to meet people.\n\nMy team doesn’t have high turnover, but I’d estimate all of the FT people are working 50-55 hours per week, with my manager working 55-60. People are online until 9 or 10 every day, most work a few hours on Sunday, etc. I really don’t want that to be my life after college, but I know if I get a return offer, it’ll be for this team.\n\nMy manager has been trying to help me with my project, but he’s constantly busy with other things, as is my mentor. Again, this is mostly my fault, as I certainly haven’t been working as hard as I’ve been able to, but it has been hard to make progress.\n\nSo, I really wanted some advice. It doesn’t look like I’m on track to receive a return offer, but even if I did, I don’t want to return to the same team. But, with the way the economy is looking, I’m really worried about FT job hunting and finding something that’s even close to as good as this offer. Does anyone have any advice? Should I just grind out the summer, return to the same team, then leave in a year when it’s easier to find jobs? Or does everyone think that there will still be plenty of new grad opportunities?

    "raw": "my internship search experienceFinally wrapped up my intern recruiting for summer 2021. Saw some other people post, and decided to share some results as well. This is my first recruiting season where I went all out, so I don't really have a good frame of reference as to how covid affected everything.\n\nAbout me:\n\n* Junior, male, top 5 CS school\n* 1 prior internship, 1 personal project (but I put slightly expanded upon school projects on resume), no research/clubs\n\nResults (diagram [https://imgur.com/a/ImZzCBB](https://imgur.com/a/ImZzCBB)):\n\n* Started applying mid-August. Most phone interviews in late Sept-early Oct. Final round hell week in mid-late Oct. Signed last week :)\n* 61 applications (mix of big N, financial firms, unicorn/startups). I had a return offer so I could afford to not apply to too many places.\n* 22 coding challenges, 11 phone screens, 10 final rounds, 3 offers\n* I skipped around 3 final rounds and 2 phone screens after I got the first offer\n\nSome reflections:\n\n* I'm a big clout-chaser. I'm happy with my offers and am lucky to have them, but part of me wishes I had done better. (I got big N, but not the \"s tier\" companies so to speak). I was so close to some of the places I really wanted to work at, but got rejected at the final round. Yes, I know this is shallow. I also tell myself that I have a whole career to get where I want, but I can't help but want it straight out of college too.\n* None of my referrals helped: I got insta-rejected by G/F and still getting ghosted by the rest. These were my top 2 choices, since I really really want to go to NYC post-grad, and G/F are two of the larger tech employers in the city, but without interning with them, it's near impossible to get placed there as a new grad. I had applied to a couple of NYC positions, but got rejected after final rounds.\n* I was pretty lousy with my first phone interviews, but I started practicing a couple hr of LC for the half-week leading up to them, and started getting pretty high pass rates (\\~70%). But for final rounds, my offer rate was just less than 50% (could have done better, didn't feel like I failed any of them, but competition is tough at that stage)\n* I stacked all but one of my final rounds across 2 weeks. I made sure to schedule the ones I didn't care for first as practice, in preparation for my important ones, which I always scheduled for thurs/fri. At night between interviews, I would do a couple hours LC. This was pretty good practice, but it doesn't work for everyone.\n* I was at home this semester, so I was hyper-focused on school + recruiting. I don't think I would have done it differently because it seemed to work out, but I still had mad fomo. Next semester I'm not worry about professional stuff and going to hang out with friends instead\n* Overall, not a bad recruiting season. I'm happy, but not satisfied, but that's for next fall. In the mean time, I'm going to relax",

    "raw": "BOA: Bank of America - SWE New Grad interview Experience I’ll preface this by saying the most important thing anyone interviewing at BOA should know is that banking is slow. Not slow like you think, it's slower. In fact, when I spoke to the director of a team on the phone one of the first things he told me was that “banking is boring and slow”. Well it's not just the development that is slow, it's the interview process as well. My interview experience is a long one and it started when a recruiter reached out to me to interview at BOA in September 2021 after I registered for GHC. I spoke to the recruiter for about a half hour (basic background questions). I was then scheduled for a 30 minute interview with a manager during the GHC event. I emailed a follow up thank you and I was informed by the recruiter that my resume was forwarded to various tech managers within BOA. I was then offered an interview for a SWE role which lasted about an hour (simple pseudo code coding on spot + technical questions). I emailed a thank you to the manager but never received a response (no surprise there). I was then invited to interview with a different team in a different location. I was initially invited to “chat” (always assume chat == code word for interview). I then interviewed with about 7 team members (at several different points) during October and November. Each interview request was sent to me with emails stating “are you free to “chat” today/tomorrow\"? Great for those who are last minute… And only one was a formal interview request. The chat interviews I attended (with about 5 different people) were mostly background questions and one or two spontaneous technical testing of my knowledge questions. (Like what is this in CSS…) For the formal interview I stated I was available on a specific day during a specific time period of 3 hours. The interviewer informed me that he would call me at the beginning of the first hour and his teammates may call me during the next two. (I definitely learned my mistake in terms of offering a 3 hour availability window on a day). The interviewer called me and asked me a series of tech questions for an hour. The questions during the “formal” interview were mostly technical basic questions (OOP, OS, JS & some math (weird ones)). I then received a call about an hour later from another team member and was asked more tech questions (purely technical & math). Around 15 minutes past the third hour I received a call from the managing director and he asked me how my interviews went... He told me he would send me the requisitions for the role they had in mind for me. I received two requisitions with SWE level III titles and a requirement of 10 years experience. I guess they thought pretty highly of me as I only had 2 years experience (and as an intern during undergrad). I actually responded and asked to clarify if these were the correct roles for me, I explicitly stated that I had not as much industry experience as listed. Never received a response from the manager. A few days later, the recruiter reached out to me (this was at the end of October) and informed me that my interviews went well and she needed to connect with me as they were \"pulling together an offer\". I discussed the benefits with her over the phone, stated my salary expectations upon her request (which she immediately said was too high and told me she would get me something lower), and she requested that I formally apply to a position online so they would be able to give me “the offer” . I naively assumed that I would be receiving an offer in the next few days. I received an email a few days later for another “chat” with more team members. I sadly agreed to the interview. I then sent a follow up after the interview and never heard back from the recruiter. I then emailed the managing director I spoke with earlier and inquired on the status of my application. He then invited me to another chat (with more team members) the very next day. It was about a half hour of basic background and some tech questions. I inquired about the interview process (as I thought I was done awhile ago?) at the end of this meeting but received a pretty indirect response. I had no idea what was next… They asked me about my existing deadlines for offers and I actually mentioned that one was really soon within the next few days. However, they pretty much hinted that the process is slow and it usually takes them 6 months to hire people (I’m not sure if this is normal as I'm literally about to graduate and the longest time period it took me to receive an offer was 3 months and I received updates on my application periodically). Well anyway, at that point I decided I couldn’t handle the interview process at BOA and wouldn’t pursue this further. I did receive an email from the recruiter 3 weeks after my last interview. She said she needed to “connect” with me as they only needed 1 more approval on my offer (disregarded my follow up email from 3 weeks prior?) . An hour later she emailed me that the role was closed. No apology, no explanation. Looks like their top candidate pulled through. I just wanted to share my experience for those interviewing as it may take long and that's not on you. And more importantly, pay attention to a company during the process. It says a lot about the company when employees lack the professionality in terms of the interview process, responding to candidates and overall organization. And definitely remember you have to want this. Like badly. Cuz its hard work just to go through the interview process, spend hours of time and your patience may just disappear like mine. Good luck & you got this.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this experience? Do you think I am overreacting? (First reddit post :())",

It started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. My interviewer also went out of his way to give me feedback on my resume and tips on answering screening questions.\n\nLike the previous interview, the assignment itself was pretty simple, in concept. However, unlike the previous interview, it dealt heavily with DSA (though I'm pretty sure it can also be solved without DSA). My interviewer first asked me to just talk with him about different possible solutions. I just threw different ideas into the air and he commented on each possible solution (prompting me for more details if needed). After about 10 minutes, I started working on my implementation, talking about what I was doing and commenting each step of the way. There were a couple of bugs in my code, which I managed to fix. Afterward, my interviewer told me that my solution was the most-optimal implementation and then quizzed me on the time and storage complexity of the code.\n\nLike last time, after the coding section was a Q&A with my interviewer. He gave me detailed answers to all the questions I asked as well as some advice as a potential intern. Overall, I went way beyond the allotted time (about 2 and a half hours in total) though my interviewer said he noticed but just wanted me to have enough time to do my best work.\n\n**Results**  \nI heard back from my recruiter the following Monday, setting up a meeting for Wednesday. During the meeting, I officially received an offer for the internship.",

I've finally received an interview call from **Google** after submitting over 900 applications. It's for the preliminary screening round, and I'm feeling both thrilled and nervous. The role requires a minimum of 2 years of experience, and I realize there are some technologies I need to refresh my knowledge on.\n\nFrom what I gather, the first round typically involves two coding questions, but I'm uncertain if they delve into other aspects of the resume as well. It's been a while since I've dabbled in leet code, and there are certain topics like graphs and dynamic programming that I've never really touched upon. It seems like I have a lot of ground to cover, and with just 9 days to prepare, I'm feeling the pressure.\n\nI'm contemplating whether I should focus solely on brushing up my coding skills on platforms like LeetCode or if I should also allocate time to revisit the skills and technologies listed on my resume. If anyone who's recently gone through a similar experience could offer some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. I really want to make the most out of my preparation time.

Algorithm patterns are crucial because once you understand the fundamentals of a pattern, a whole class of related problems suddenly become *a lot* easier to solve.\n\n## How do you study algorithm patterns?\n\nTo learn the fundamentals of an algorithm pattern, start with a simple example problem that demonstrates why the pattern is useful. Use that problem to understand the basic structural components of the pattern. Then, apply what you learned by solving a few follow-up questions on your own.\n\nI’ve broken down the fundamentals and created animated solutions for the follow-up questions for the following algorithm patterns, which are a great place to start because they don’t require additional knowledge of data structures beyond arrays.\n\nMake sure you understand the types of questions that are a good fit for each pattern (covered in the fundamentals page for each pattern).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Two-Pointer

important?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Let's say you get a question which gives you a string, and asks you to return the longest substring within that string without repeating characters.Since this is asking for a substring within a string that meets a certain criteria (no repeating characters), you know this question is a [good candidate](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#when-do-i-use-this) for the sliding window.\n* You know that the sliding window pattern involves using two pointers to represent the current window, along with a data structure to store the contents of the window. You can immediately start thinking about the appropriate data structure (a set or a dictionary are good choices for this problem!) to use.\n* Now you’ve identified the structural components for this problem, you can begin to translate them into code, using a [template](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window#template) for the sliding window as a starting point.\n\nThis is why algorithm patterns are important: once you’ve identified that a question is a good candidate for an algorithm pattern, you have a structured foundation from which to solve problem solving from.\n\n# Unit 2: Data Structures\n\nThis set of questions will teach you the **data structures you are most likely to encounter during the coding interview, and recognizing the types of problems that are best suited for each.**\n\nStart by understanding the operations that each data structure supports, as well as the asymptotic runtimes (Big-O) of each operation. Then, work through the sample problems to get a sense of how the data structure simplifies each problem.\n\nI’ve written up a guide and animated solutions to the follow-up questions for the Stack data structure.

I talked with the recruiter slightly over 1 week ago and he told me the next step would be a zoom interview with the hiring manager. he told me that i should expect mainly behavioral questions on the interview. I, desperate for any hope at a summer internship, welcomed the news and awaited my zoom interview.\n\nToday I just had the zoom interview and all I could say is that it was the exact opposite of what I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily being asked technical questions that bothered me; it was the type of questions I was being asked. I was being asked questions that were easily googlable and in my opinion did not assess my ability to perform the job. These questions were basically memorization questions about specific programming languages' syntax. Worst of all, it was humiliating to sit there and answer that \"I'm quite proficient with this language\" before being bombarded with very specific questions about features of the language and having to respond \"I'm not sure...\" \n\nAnyways after the interview I'm really considering reaching out to the recruiter and explaining what happened. Again, I'm not bothered about being asked technical questions (especially things that were on my resume) but to me these technical questions were doing too much given that I was told \"mostly behavioral\".

    "raw": "This sub needs to stop with the whole \"take an unpaid internship\" because \"it's better than no internship\" and even worse \"you're getting paid in experience\"**It's harming the entire job market**\n\nFirst off, it's against the entire industry's best interest to take an unpaid internship. Have you noticed how entry level jobs are decreasing? And even more so entry level jobs with reasonable requirements? Have you also noticed how unpaid internships are also rising? I wonder why! Unpaid internships and its rise in popularity will make it the next entry-level job. Before internships used to be purely optional and you can still land a decent paying entry level job. Now you need them to have a shot and landing any decent roles.\n\nBy working unpaid you are devaluing the work of everyone in the industry, companies will go \"why should I pay my interns when I can just not pay them?\" they already are doing in plenty of other industries. By taking unpaid internships you are making it the new entry level job. With this mentality soon unpaid internships are a must have to get your foot in the door for this career. Unpaid internships are creating a \"race to the bottom\" market harming the employees.\n\nThe narrative of \"young people are so entitled  in that they want good money\" is already shifting towards \"young people are so entitled in that they want to get paid for their work period\"\n\nalbiet this is almost exclusively from old people and a vocal minority the presence of this narrative at all is scary.\n\n**They're illegal most of the time if it's a for-profit company and unethical**\n\nMost countries have laws against unpaid internships if it **displaces the work of a paid employee**. The [FLSA in the USA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) says so. In Canada it depends on the provinces but most of them will only allow it if it's for school, in Ontario it's the same as well as similar standards as set in the [Employment Standards Act](https://www.svlaw.ca/blog/details/item/unpaid-internships-what-does-the-employment-standards-act-say-) like it is in the USA. As you can guess, most fail at that part.\n\nIt's also unethical because the argument of \"it's for educational and training purposes so you shouldn't be paid\" holds no merit. Most jobs out there will still pay you during training, do you think it's ethical to not be paid for that? The other issue like I said before it's more than training, you are more likely than not going to be doing the work of a paid employee. So the argument that unpaid internships are purely educational is wrong period.\n\n**Most of the time it's a waste of time**\n\nSaying that \"this job pays in experience\" is like beverage companies saying \"this drink keeps you hydrated\". If the best the unpaid internship has to offer is experience is the bare minimum for EVERY job out there is it really that valuable? If the experience really is that valuable why don't they pay you for it?\n\n**The whole \"no internship is worse than unpaid internship\" is wrong, statistics show unpaid internships actually don't improve your career prospects**\n\nAccording to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) those who did an unpaid internship had more or less the same career prospect compared to those who did no internship at all.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/)\n\n>This year, NACE queried more than 9,200 seniors from February through the end of April. [They found](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx) that  63.1 percent of students with a paid internship under their belt had  received at least one job offer. But only 37 percent of former unpaid  interns could say the same -- a negligible 1.8 percentage points more  than students who had never interned.    \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The results were even worse when it came to salary. Among students who found jobs**, former unpaid interns were actually offered** ***less*** **money than those with no internship experience**.\n\nLet's assume that unpaid internships are much more likely to land jobs. Do we want to live in a society like that? Do we want a society where you have to work for free while having sky high rent, inflation, and student loans?\n\n**There are better options**\n\nThere are better options that are ethical and legal while being more valuable than an unpaid internship and even actually creating a positive impact to society some of them include\n\n\\- Doing a side project yourself\n\n\\- Contributing to open source\n\n\\- Doing it for a non-profit organization you support in",

    "raw": "Microsoft SWE Intern Interview ResultsHey yall,\n\nI wanted to share my recent experience with the Microsoft interview process. This is an update from my previous post. I applied online, submitted my resume, and, to my surprise, I received an email congratulating me on reaching the final interview round without any technical phone screens.\n\n# \n\n# My Background:\n\nI got a lot of questions asking how I got pushed to the final round, here are my qualifications:\n\n* Previous internship at defense company\n* Athlete in college\n* Technical Military experience\n* Minority\n\nI go to a liberal arts states school that is no where near ranked. I also have a very mediocre GPA at 3.1 but I seclude it from my resume so they wouldn't know. (they also never asked)\n\n# \n\n# My Prep:\n\nI scheduled the interviews around 3 weeks from the initial email. For preparations I never took Data Structures and Algorithms before so a lot of my time was learning DSA. I took a Udemy course by Scott Barret called:\n\n[Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://parsons.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/)\n\nI was able to access this course for free due to my previous internship's Udemy Business account. It was incredibly helpful, especially because of the animations explaining each data structure and the coding problems after each lesson.\n\nI also used Leetcode, where my Leetcode Premium subscription allowed me to pinpoint the types of questions Microsoft asks. The Microsoft Explore Card had every question asked to me during my interview except one.\n\n# \n\n# Interview Day:\n\nOn the interview day, they scheduled a 6-hour block of time. In the morning, a recruiter brought everyone into a Microsoft Teams call to introduce everyone and answer questions. This person would be the one delivering the offer letter or the declination email.\n\nIn my first interview, I initially thought the interviewer wouldn't show up because he was 5 minutes late. Eventually, he arrived, and after introductions, he asked me a couple of questions about my resume. Then, he pasted a Leetcode Medium problem about Linked Lists into the Teams chat, which was also on the Microsoft Explore Card. He asked me to walk through a solution. I got most of the problem right, except for a crucial part about the data structure. After that, I asked him a series of questions I had prepared until the next interview.\n\nFor the second interview, it was a similar experience with the interviewer being about 5 minutes late. This interviewer seemed disinterested and preoccupied. We didn't exchange introductions; she simply went over my resume and asked questions about my previous internship. Afterward, she sent a Codility link where she presented three coding questions, all of which were relatively easy. I made a mistake with the first question because I didn't fully understand it. She allowed me to try again with some more common questions about Linked Lists, which I answered flawlessly. Once the coding was done, I attempted to ask her questions, but she said she had to leave after just one question and suggested connecting on LinkedIn if I had more. (She did not connect back lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results:\n\nExactly a week later, I received an email from the recruiter informing me that I did not pass the interview. However, I am not giving up. I plan to take the lessons from this experience, learn from them, and come back stronger. If any of you have questions, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer, but if they're too private, I might not be able to.\n\nLet's turn this moment of setback into one of motivation and resilience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for being an amazing community.",

My interview was initially scheduled on September 16, but to \"unforeseen circumstances\", it ended up being pushed back to today, September 28.\n\n**Interview Process**  \nThe interview started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. I introduces myself (major, interests, etc.) then answered a couple of questions about my resume (robotics team, volunteer work, etc.) then we went directly into the coding assignment.\n\nThe assignment itself was pretty simple, akin to a LeetCode easy-ish medium. Specifically, it focused on string manipulation with a touch of DSA. My interviewer gave me a minute to think over the problem and gather my thoughts. I just voiced random ideas for the individual criteria until I had a rough plan on how I was going to implement it. After I told my interviewer my design, he said it sounded like it would work. I started my implementation while commenting each step of the algorithm, talking aloud the entire time I was working. I managed to implement a solution, which initially had a bug that I managed to fix, and ran some random test cases which worked until the very last test case. My interviewer managed to identify the bug, giving me a hint where I should look, but I couldn't manage to find and fix it before time ran out.\n\nAfter the coding section was a brief Q&A, with me asking him questions (why Uber, previous jobs, college major, advice for interns, etc.) and him answering my questions, though we went slightly over the 1 hour time slot.\n\n**Results**  \nI recieved an email from my recruiter about an hour and a half after my interview, letting me know that I moved onto the second interview.",

I can go into detail but there's a bunch of description everywhere. Basically 6 questions off some topics (hard af) and then 1 LC ez followed by 1 LC med.\n4. Final round interview scheduled day after my first round. This is where shit gets wonky. They informed me it will be behavioral only, assessing leadership etc. I looked online and people basically confirmed it would be behavioral, potentially some git vc questions. My interview came up and my guy was a complete no show. Not even late, just ghosted. Contacted my interviewer and he let me reschedule. Then I hop in the interview with anotha guy the next day, and the first thing homie does is open a word doc and we do some LC. I tried to tell him I already did my coding interview and they told me it would be behav only, but he didn't care. A lil hard to understand him. I had an LC ez followed by an LC med... again. Was able to solve both, and finally the guy wrapped up in 15 min with some \"Name a time when...\".\n5.

(They give your Resume & GPA as well but to apply to the selections they have you must send a cover letter). A lot of these companies they have listed are purely Biotech / Health related which wasn’t exactly what I wanted at the time but to be honest in this field you take what you can get.\n\nI applied 10 hours before the deadline and got my chance to see all the companies, with CUIMC being one of the first I applied to. They had multiple options for different mentors you could intern with. I wrote a quick cover letter stating how I thought I could contribute & why I wanted my current mentor. \n\nAbout two weeks later they got back to me with details of the internship & to set up an interview. I met with my current mentor and it was genuinely the best interview i’ve ever had. I suffer with very bad imposter syndrome so it was surprising to me when he found my resume amazing. He loved what I had for my skills and projects, with great remarks toward my Transcript as well (mind you I have a 2.4 GPA) and we continued to talk about what I could contribute to with details of multiple projects I could work on. We ended the interview with a talk about potentially staying on afterwards. I was ecstatic when it ended because for once I felt like maybe this was it.\n\nOnly a week later, I found out I was right. I was offered the position making 18.50 for 40 hours a week working from home whenever I wanted to. I happily accepted and started June 3rd. \n\nNow to finally talk about my experience, as it was nothing short of amazing.\n\nFrom the moment I came in I was greeted by the friendliest coworkers and my supervisor (mentor) was simply the chillest guy I’ve ever met. We had a chat about the project i’d be working on (Which I can’t give details about because we are planning to publish a paper!) and I started my onboarding process which is always a hassle. But he told me to just work from home for the rest of the week on my 2nd day lol.  \n\nA week later he hands me my own laptop to work from (Really awesome, 256gb RAM, nvidia GPU, massive memory, was really happy) & I got straight to work. \n\nWhat was really great about my project was that I got to build it from the ground up. I built the backend foundation in python. Gathering data from databases and running it through cleaning processes, visualization and output. Building my own database for our group and eventually having to build a mini front end that they could use to see how everything looked (I just used the Tkinter GUI). \n\nWe also had a great office, with windows larger than I ever seen & a view of new york I appreciated every time I saw it. \n\nThough I did have a lot of stressful moments trying to understand what I was even doing and fitting deadlines, it was really fulfilling when I did get it done. I always got positive feedback and my supervisor always told me I was crushing it. I got great remarks from all my peers and it was a great feeling.\n\nDuring this process I really learned so much. I discovered my real passion in CS which is to focus on the data path and work in the health sector, building tools for people to use. I feel that is where I shine the best. \n\nI end next week and i’m happy to say that I’ve been offered a part time position while I go to school making $25+, with talks of a full time position coming my way when I graduate. He told me the salaries for a full time position are typically greater than 90k which is amazing. I genuinely couldn’t be happier and i’m going to be graduating with so much experience in my belt. \n\nAll in all, it is not FAANG or bust!

The interview process consisted of four rounds in total. The first round was a 30-minute HR screening. The second round was five assessments covering Microsoft Excel, SQL, an Attention to detain test, and a personality assessment. The third round was a 45-minute interview with the Director of the division. The fourth and final round will be a 45-minute interview with two of the more junior members of the team (like a small panel interview 2 VS.1) along with 1 last 15-minute interview with another hiring manager.\n\nThere are two things that I'm thinking about. My third round interview with the Director was very relaxed and laid-back. They didn't really ask me too much about myself nor did they ask any behavioral/ S.T.A.R. questions.

    "raw": "How A Software Engineer Used Facebook Ads To Land An Interview at RedditHey guys -\n\nHere's a fun story about how Chris Seline (a software engineer) used FB ads to target the CEO of Reddit and get an interview. Main lesson is that you don't need to keep blasting your resume - try to be creative :)\n\n\\----------\n\nThe traditional way to get a job interview is to submit your resume and pray.\n\nEveryone does this and it’s taken to be the default because it’s easy. You can send the same resume with the click of a button to totally different companies, no effort on your part other than preparing the resume.\n\nThere’s no way to stand out, no uniqueness.\n\nGenerally, the way to get around this is to ask for a referral or to reach out to someone at the company for some sort of informational interview. Both of these methods allow for a more personalized approach to job hunting.\n\nBut is it possible to go even one step further?\n\n**Stand Out**\n\nIn 2016, [Chris Seline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dumbfounder/) was coming off a failed startup and looking for new opportunities.\n\nUnlike most other people, though, Chris wasn’t a fan of the resume blast method.\n\nHis strategy was to target specific companies and try to get noticed creatively rather than use the traditional channels and get lost in the shuffle.\n\nChris decided that he really wanted to work for Reddit.\n\nHis plan was to write a [blog post](https://twicsy-blog.tumblr.com/post/135712326189/hey-reddit-lets-make-some-recommendations) and then email it to the CEO of Reddit.\n\nThe blog post is thorough - it’s 2000 words, technical, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into it.\n\nEven if Chris had emailed his post to the Reddit CEO, there’s a strong chance he would have gotten an interview. 99% of applicants don’t put this much effort into an application and receiving such a personalized email is a positive signal.\n\nBut Chris didn’t just email him.\n\n**Facebook Ads**\n\nHe decided to use Facebook Ads to target the CEO of Reddit (Steve Huffman).\n\nHere’s how he did it:\n\n1. Find the Reddit CEO’s public Facebook profile\n2. Use this to find out where he lived, what he liked, what he was interested in, etc\n3. Use the above to run a super targeted FB Ads Campaign\n\nNote that Chris only wanted *one* person to click on this Ad, that’s why he had to go super targeted.\n\nThe Ad simply said: \"Steve: Reddit needs Recommendations\"\n\n**The Result**\n\nChris ended up spending $10. The ad reached 197 people. 4 People clicked on it. One of them was the CEO of Reddit.\n\nNext thing you know, Reddit HR reached out to schedule an interview. Nicely done.\n\nI contacted Chris to find out if he actually got the job - here’s what he said:\n\n*I did not. It turns out they were just starting a search for \"head of search\" at Reddit, and asked if I would like to interview for that job. That would have been my dream job, and definitely worth a move across the country, even with 3 kids and a wife in tow (I live in DC), so naturally I was very excited and said yes. But after a few talks they thought I didn't have enough experience with big companies, so they asked if I would be interested in an IC role. I was, but I wasn't willing to move across the country for that, and they didn't want to hire remote workers. So that was that.*\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nThe reason this is a fun story is because of the FB Ads.\n\nBut I think what people may gloss over is the amount of time and research Chris put into writing the blog post that he eventually showed to the Reddit CEO.\n\nIf we go back to the beginning of this case study, notice how I mentioned that just blasting a resume to a company signals nothing unique and frankly a lack of effort.\n\nChris’ blog post was well researched, relevant, and made him stand out. The FB Ads targeting was just the cherry on top.\n\nNext time you see a job you really want to get, think about how you can go that one step further.\n\n**Thanks for reading**\n\nYou can view the original article with nice images [here](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/how-to-land-interview-using-fb-ads). I'll be in the comments if anyone wants to discuss :)\n\nI write case studies about tech careers for new grads. Would love it if you checked out my [newsletter](https://www.careerfair.io/).",

So frustrating as I knew the problem by heart, just froze.\n* LC Easy. Covered every criteria and proposed ways to expand into OOD if there was future restrictions.\n* LC Easy. Explained how to implement and interviewer said to go ahead and code it out. Again froze when interviewer made one small suggestion about ommiting an if statement for a single line. It was a more elegant solution, but for some reason derailed my thought process. Interviewer had to help me decide on a sorted data strucutre as I couldn't think of any during my freeze.\n\n**Overall:** Not sure what to expect... for all questions I explained the most optimal solutions, but for two I was not able to produce the complete code. For the leadership principle questions, I believe everything went really well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Anyone have any insight as to what I should expect?** Right now I am thinking I have about a 50% chance which is somehow more unsettling than 0%!

    "raw": "My Bloomberg interview experienceHello everyone,\n\nIn this post, I wanted to share my Bloomberg interview experience, how I prepared and final compensation offer I received. This was back in April and only recently I received the details of my compensation.\n\nYou can read this on my blog as well (which has better editing) - [https://dev.to/dfs\\_with\\_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb](https://dev.to/dfs_with_memo/my-bloomberg-interview-experience-5nb)\n\n# Interview Experience\n\nSo, I applied for a SWE role(not a new grad) and heard back from a Bloomberg recruiter in April. I scheduled my first technical phone screen three weeks from the time I was contacted.\n\nTechnical phone screen 45 minutes - My interviewer asked me questions on my resume for around 15 minutes and then gave me a variation of number of islands.\n\nThe next day I was contacted by my recruiter and I was informed I will be moving to the next round which is a virtual on-site that consists of technical rounds. I was asked to keep 3-4 hours aside for the rounds but I wasn't told how many rounds and what kind except that the first will be a technical round.\n\nMy virtual on-site started at 11am a week later. The first round was indeed a technical round with two interviewers. One of them was shadowing the main interviewer. My interviewer was nice, he introduced himself and gave me a brief overview of how the interview would be structured. Then we spent 15 minutes on my resume to understand what type of work I had done and what I am currently working on, what are my technical interests etc. Then we moved to the first problem. It was a very verbose problem on handling buy requests in the front office of a trading desk and it had multiple requirements. But I saw that all of the requirement aligned with implementing a min stack so I explained that to the interviewer. He was happy and allowed me to code up the solution. He asked me for the time complexity of each function and we discussed a bit on some of the edge cases. Next he gave me another problem on balanced parenthesis which was straightforward enough on the first attempt and I told him a stack approach. He was satisfied and I coded it up. Then he gave me a follow up to solve it without using a stack. I struggled a bit here and he was trying to nudge me in the right direction. I came up with an O(n\\^2) algorithm but he pushed me to give him a O(n) and constant space solution which I finally was able to come up with. The interviewer was quite satisfied and we ended there. It took about 1 hour. He told me I will have one more round in half an hour.\n\nMy next interviewer showed up in 15 minutes and he told me that he can wait for 15 more minutes because he was early. I told him that I am ready. So again we spoke for around 10 minutes about my resume and the he gave me the first question which was a variation of all paths from source to destination. I was able to come up with the solution quite easily and coded it up. Then he asked me the time complexity and I really struggled with it though it wasn't complicated at all. He had to finally tell me. We spent the same amount of time on the time complexity as that on the actual problem. My mind was kind of fried at that time. Since we had time, he gave me another problem involving hashmaps (it is one of the most frequently asked questions in Bloomberg). I was able to solve it because I had done the problem before and we finished before time. He informed me that I have an HR round in 45 minutes.\n\nHR round - lasted for 30 minutes and again I was asked about my previous work experience, how many people I would interact with, did I work with stakeholders, why am I doing a master's now and why in the US etc. The HR told me that I am done with the virtual on-site and my recruiter will let me know on the next steps\n\nIt was a while, I don't remember the exact time but I was contacted by my recruiter and they let me know that I had one more round this time with an engineering manager. I scheduled it for a week from the date I was informed.\n\nEM round - This was taken a very senior manager at Bloomberg(>25 YOE at Bloomberg). He wanted to know about my experience with different programming languages. He asked me to differentiate between C++,Python and Java, asked couple of standard behavioral questions and gave me advice on how to succeed as an engineer at Bloomberg.\n\nI was contacted by a different HR a week later and was told they are giving me a verbal offer but because I can't join them till 2023 beginning they can give me the comp details sometime in Aug because thats when they are going to finalize the details for 2023. It took them a bit more time than expected but they gave me the comp details few days back.\n\n# Compensation\n\nTotal TC - 182k (excluding benefits such as health insurance)\n\nEDIT - negotiated up for a total TC of 195k\n\n# How I prepared\n\nI had solved problems from CTCI on leetcode, solved majority of blind 75 problems and I had collected questions asked in previous Bloomberg interviews from leetcode discuss section and geeksforgeeks to prepare. I had started solving Leetcode problems from December end of last year and my final LC count(if that matters) on the day of my virtual on-site was 289.",

    "raw": "How I Got OAs and Interviews With No ExperienceThis sub is the reason I was able to land a solid internship, so I figured I'd give back and try to give some advice on what helped me land interviews. I was sent 20 OAs out of 90 apps, and had final interviews with Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and some others to give an idea of the companies I had processes with. I'm a Junior with a 3.5 GPA at a solid college (not a target school for companies recruiting developers, nor a T25 college, but solid), and the only previous experience I have is in education. Mind you, I am by no means a CS wizard or anything like that, but I am certainly competent.\n\nHonestly there's no secret to getting OAs and interviews, or even passing them. Preparing is a pain in the ass, and there is absolutely luck involved in getting offers.\n\nWhile we all know internships are one of the best ways to actually have companies send you an OA, what if you don't have one? I was in this situation, but the one thing that I am confident carried me hard af in getting OAs was a good personal project. Solid projects show initiative, imply you have a genuine interest in programming, and a host of other things that recruiters search for. When I say solid, I mean I literally sold a program to many customers and worked directly with them to implement new features and improvements. I learned new concepts and technologies related to databases, designing UIs, multi-threading, and a ton other things while working on this project.\n\n\"Why do I care?\" you may be asking? Well, everything about this project portrays me as a candidate who is willing/eager to learn, takes initiative, experienced in working directly with other people, solving problems, and working independently. These are things I touched on when describing my project in my resume, and helped me get through behaviorals during interviews. What's important is that you choose a project that involves bringing together a lot of different tech to build some sort of product or application, not if you sell it (though this is admittedly a major plus). I suggest starting a project over break, and building something you ACTUALLY THINK IS INTERESTING. If you don't believe in what you're making, the final product is likely going to be mid. If you put your heart into the project, it shows.\n\nYou can make a good project but if you can't sell it on your resume, it's worthless for getting interviews and OAs. At the very least you should spend an hour or two just sitting there revising your resume and making it top tier (formatting, use big words and keywords, sell yourself well). Make sure you have your resume reviewed by friends/peers/professors, and focus on putting in KEYWORDS. Things like 'collaborate', 'problem solving'  and other relevant words or phrases will help push you through resume screens (advice given to me from a friend at a Big N company).\n\nFor interviews? Don't be a dick and leetcode lol. Literally bro I started leetcoding in late August, and solved 201 problems by now (way more than needed). For technical prep, when leetcoding, read the problem and make sure you understand both input and output. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I HAVE DONE WHEN LEETCODING: think of a data structure that will help you solve the problem (and know when you don't need one). This ties into understanding input and output, and knowing what data structure you need to use should be pretty clear right after reading a problem. 9 times out of 10 this will be enough for you to pass technical interviews. &lt;- Seriously. You can roll out of bed and pass interviews because knowing what data structures to use will point you in the correct direction to solve the problem. When you're solving the interviewer's coding problem, state the data structure or approach you're thinking of going with, and see how they react to get a feel if you're on the right track.\n\nFor behaviorals, research the company and its product(s) just in case you're asked about them, and prepare like 10 stories to fit any situational question. No story for a particular question? Heavily modify an experience you've had to match the question being asked. No stories at all? Make them up. Also, don't be weird or an asshole lol.\n\nThat's really all I've got and what helped me. I'm confident these things will help me land a good new grad offer next cycle, and hopefully they can help ya'll too. I didn't get an offer until this month, and I started applying in August. When you see other people getting offers, try to use that as inspiration and motivation. They're getting opportunities that you absolutely have the ability to get with diligent preparation. I was rejected in almost all of my final round interviews, and was rejected on the first OA 16 times, but I never thought of myself as a walking L. You need to believe in yourself before other people will. Nobody owes you a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this helps at least one person, then I consider this a tremendous W. If anyone has any questions please ask, this community has helped me a TON and I'd love to give back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Amazon",

If you can solve the problem, you should get the offer right? While it certainly helps a lot, there's a lot more that's being looked at that I think isn't really brought up in this sub. I stumbled across a piece of documentation I found at my company that talks about interviews. The questions they proposed are all LC easy, but they aren't necessarily asking for you to solve them. So what are they asking for?\n\n* Can you come up with different test cases than the ones provided? What about different and special edge cases? \n* Are you able to explain your thought process and work together with your interviewer? Do you communicate well?\n* Do you use appropriate and descriptive variable names?\n\nEssentially, they want to gauge what it'll be like to work with you. While being intelligent and a great problem solver are skills to value, being likable and approachable goes a lot further. Similarly, you can also see how even if you're able to quickly find the solution for the problem, you could still get rejected.",

Apply and fill out the hiring assessment (competency questions about how you work and what you would do in different situations)\n2. 3 weeks later: Contacted by recruiter giving me information to schedule a live technical through Karat. The live technical was around a week later. Interview was 1hr long consisting of 6 questions on 2 topics of your choice. I chose OOP and Testing I think. Live coding was 45 minutes long. I had 2 med-easy questions. IDK if they were leetcode as I have never seen them before. I finished the first one pretty quick. First you are asked to explain your approach. Then you type some code and debug. I explained my solution and passed all the test cases in about 15-20 minutes. The second question was harder. It took more thinking. My first approach didn't account for some edge cases so I didn't have time to finish. I explained my new approach that actually worked (I tested this after the interview). I would have been able to write the new code if I had about 5 more minutes.\n3. Next Day: Got the email saying I passed and I needed to schedule the final behavioral interview. The behavioral was also a little over a week after I was notified I passed the technical. I interviewed with a Senior SWE and he was really nice and chill. Probably one of the nicest interviewers I have ever had. It lasted a little over 40 minutes. He asked 3 questions. They were technical and behavioral at the same time. You needed to talk about the technical side and it was also assessing your soft skills.\n4. Day after behavioral: Got my verbal offer from my recruiter.

I had an interview on Friday with a company at 1 pm and I was on the zoom call by 12:50. My interviewers showed up 10 mins late to a 45 minute interview so my time was already cut very short. One of the interviewer then struggled to turn her mic on for another 5 minutes and when she did it started echoing. After that, the interview started. This is for an internship position for an application development role. They asked me about multithreading and arrays vs linked lists. I told them I didn’t really know what multithreading was but I knew threads, and they continued to ask me large scale questions and grill me on it. After that we went into the coding round. They made me SCREENSHOT the problem and code on my own IDE while screen-sharing which I thought was so stupid, there are free code  share websites. The problem was a medium leetcode problem, and I knew the solution but I wrote my code in like 5 mins because I was heavily rushed to start coding by my interviewers and then when I was done and double checking it, they were like ok we’re gonna take a screenshot and move onto behavioral. I didn’t even get to run my code or test my code. They asked me two behavioral questions and then asked me about my cybersecurity minor and started grilling me on encryption algorithms when I told them I had not taken a course in encryption algorithms yet. But they continued to ask so I just tried to problem solve it. Then the interviewer looked at my resume and said so it looks like you have ML experience should I ask you about ML or operating systems? I just told him my only experience in ML is from a summer project for an internship and that I don’t know much after that. So he starts grilling me about operating systems, and I answer his questions correctly but the other interviewer keeps talking over me every time I say something slightly wrong she starts like talking over me and saying no. And then he’s like ok we’re out of time you have to ask us questions and I literally just asked them what their favorite part about the company was and they couldn’t even say anything about it. They said their teams, but nothing positive about the company. This interview was absolute garbage and I don’t think I did bad except for the topics which I told them I had no experience in that they continued to grill me on. My interviewers were rude and the set up / format for coding was horrendous. What do you guys think?

There are projects, there are moderators in our Discord helping people get situated, etc. but my gosh, this is a total train wreck.\n\nYes, it's free.  \nYes, it is *something* to put on your resume. However, this environment is absolute chaos, the program itself is disorganized, the co-founders have some red flag behavior, and communication down right sucks.  \n  \nLet's start off with the fact that 41,000 people applied and they accepted almost 16,000 people. Imagine *half* of those people in a single Discord, bombarding all the chats with questions because most of us have no idea what's going on. We receive information (like schedules, Zoom links) at the last minute, and when we do receive that information, it's incredibly broad and you come to accept that you're going to be confused for the next 7 weeks. \n\nNow, onto today--the day we were supposed to attend a kick-off meeting. Typically the co-founders will drop the link to the Zoom call in the #announcements channel. I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the link to drop. Nothing. I was at least an hour early, at my desk, plugged in and ready to click.  \nNot today, apparently. The link was sent by email (unless there is another place that I'd say 80% of us aren't aware of). I received the link MINUTES after the meeting was supposed to start, and when I tried to join, the Zoom call maxed out in attendance. \n\nWhy would you press the importance of attending the kick off meeting, accept 16,000 people, and only make it possible for 1,000 people to attend?\n\nBut wait, it gets better. Co-founder Yasin posts this in the announcements channel afterwards. \"we capped zoom to 1000. this was by choice for a few reasons: people who show up early will usually benefit earlier. Usually the people who apply early to jobs have a bigger advantage esp for f500 companies. This will be the easiest route for most to get a job.\"  \n???  \nAh, yes. Let's gaslight all the people who couldn't get into the Zoom call because Headstarter couldn't send a link on time. You want to see who shows up early? Send the link early. Let people show up 15 minutes early and stop accepting guests right when it starts. Honestly, it's big big red flag behavior. There's clearly a lack of organization or preparation on the founders' end, and instead they blamed it on fellows and made it sound like they did it on purpose.\n\nLet's also talk about the dashboard - I've been on the dashboard to see what I'm supposed to work on for the week and the due dates KEEP CHANGING. Right before my eyes! The day we're supposed to start working on our projects. The due dates change, the order changes, and some things are being completely removed from it. \n\nAnd then the co-founders are so quick to post about all the cool things they did on LinkedIn. I get it, I too post things I'm proud of on LinkedIn, but it feels inauthentic while 15,000 of us couldn't even join the kick off meeting.   \n  \nIt feels a lot like appearances.  \nBut also, *I'm* here for appearances, I just didn't think this fellowship would be as messy as it is. I was really excited and ready to go. I also wasn't expecting to see unaccountable CEO tech behavior right out the gate. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still participating. Game recognizes game.

Basically, she told me the internal team I applied to decided to stop my hiring process because they found the whole crew they needed and there were no more open positions. As you may suspect,  I felt so bad because it was the final step. I was prepared to ace the interview. I spent my free time preparing for nothing. I devoted the last two months to grinding leetcode, mastering algorithms, and preparing for behavioral questions, reading a bunch of books for the system design interview. I sacrificed weekends, evenings with friends, and even some family time, believing it would pay off.\n\nBut this experience has taught me a valuable life lesson: companies don't care about you. Your time and well-being are yours to manage. I realized I was so focused on impressing this company that I forgot to live my life. I missed out on moments that I can't get back.\n\nSo, here's my takeaway: Work hard, but not at the expense of your life. Your worth isn't defined by a job or a salary. Take care of yourself, enjoy life, and don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's more to life than grinding for a job that can replace you in a heartbeat. Remember, you're more than just a potential employee; you're a person with a life worth living.\n\nWishing everyone here the best in their endeavors, but don't forget to live a little too.",

Common mistakes with interview prep and leetcode.This will be long, but I feel like I have to say this, because this constantly bothers me on numerous subreddits, on leetcode, on hackerrank, on every one of these sites, the way people approach leetcode and why these sites are just assbackwards.\n\nTo start with my credentials is I've 15 years as a developer, I interviewed candidates at my last job for two years, I have had enough interviews to know how they work, and I have a secret weapon for knowing how they work.... we'll get to that. \n\nLet's start with the first issue I have.  How many problems you solve DOES NOT MATTER.  \"But if I get X solutions....\"   \n\nI need to start here, no.   Let's say you think '2000 solved problems will get you the attention of some company.\"  I could create a bot that reads the top solution, pastes that in, get the score and move on to the next answer.  In fact I know someone who did, wrote about it..  And this was five years ago.  And companies have ALSO read that.  So having X answers\" doesn't really matter.    \n\n\"But I get a solution for every puzzle.\"   Ok that's a good sign.  But can you do it under time pressure? \n\n\"I solve their 3 question timed coding reviews, so I'm ready?\"  Again that's a good sign, but here's the thing.  Leetcode has taught you to \"Solve problems\", that's not actually what's important in an interview. \n\nHere's what a interviewer ACTUALLY care about.  They do care that you can break down and solve the puzzle, but the important part is not the perfect solution.  The important part is the first thing. BREAKING DOWN the problem. \n\nIf you sat down and solve the puzzle with a perfect solution in ten seconds after the interviewer has given you it, the interviewer basically has to assume you memorized the solution, even if he didn't your solution has not told him anything about you, or actually it likely has told him NOT to hire you. \n\n\"Not to hire me, but I got the right solution.\"  Did you?  Did you ask any questions, did you discuss the problem, did you understand the parameters that might be passed in, how the function would be used, how often will it be used, what is more important speed or memory size?   Did you design a test plan ahead of time?\n\n\"Ok I asked questions, so then I can write my memorized solution.\"   Again if you just write down a perfect solution wordlessly it's not a good sign.  Again the important think is how you're breaking down a problem.  What approaches are you considering, what algorithms do you know.  you might have used a map, but why did you use a map?  These are things you should be communicating to the interviewer, because that's more important than if your code even works.  \n\n\"Well sure that's how you approach your interviews but I bet FAANG companies care....\"   Let me explain my secret weapon, which is EXACTLY why I know this is how (almost) every single interviewer approaches these interviews.  Ready? \n\nBecause they tell you.  Not the interviewer, but the recruiter.  I was laid off in November, I've done a few interviews (unfortunately passed the phone screen at google... a week before the layoffs) and every single interviewer tells you in a not so coded way this is what matters.  Many recruiters for the company straight up tell you how to approach it.  Every \"How our interview process\" seems to mention it.  I'm sick of hearing about it, that's how many times it comes up. \n\nThey literally tell you at the bare minimum \"talk through your solution.\"   \n\nAnd the real damning problem is leetcode absolutely doesn't test this, or train this.  You can post your own solutions, and if you do you're probably ahead of the curve, but what matters to Leetcodes score keeping is \"solutions\" which is what people brag about, and I see that all over this place. \n\nWhat matters in a real interview is being able to take in parameters, break down the problem, discuss potential solution. They don't care that much if you get the correct solution on the first attempt, especially if you are collaborating well.  You will notice sometimes they give you small hints to get there, that's usually fine at most levels. \n\nSo instead of worrying about how many answers you get, or how optimized your solutions are.  Worry more about how you're developing your solutions and more importantly how you're communicating them.  If you have someone else who is interviewing, practice interviewing each other.  One of you takes a question, solves it (Reads the solution tabs too to really understand it) and then does an interview on the other to see how clear you're communicating with each other, because that's what is REALLY getting tested in those interviews.  \n\n\"Well this is wrong because of....\"  Listen, I'm here trying to help because because I'm so sick of misinformation, and decided to write something up somewhere on the internet.  You don't have to treat me like an expert, I'm probably not an expert, and some shitty company somewhere does exist that cares more about rote memorization than your approach.   \n\nBut I also can tell you 0 percent of the FAANG care more about the answer than understanding your process and you probably shouldn't work at a company that cares more about \"Answers\" than approaches, because real programming is breaking down hard problems.   Not memorizing solutions to leetcode. \n\n\"So you're are you really saying don't use leetcode on the leetcode subreddit?\"  Actually no.  But what I'm saying is don't focus only on solutions or number of answers.  Worry about the solution as much as the approach, build your tool box with a lot of useful functions, data structures, and approaches, but also understand why and how you're needing them.  Learn what Dynamic programming is (Which is a whole other rant, but we'll skip that now).  Learn how to approach graphs, trees, two or three dimensional arrays.   But once you're able to answer most of the medium questions, grinding will have minimal return.\n\nBasically worry more about how you explain your solution to the interviewer, because at the end of the day, that's really what you're tested on.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully you learned something, and if you already knew this... then it was never intended for you.  \n\nPS. Also practice systems design because oooh boy that's important and ooh boy, people really biff that one.",

    "raw": "Leetcode grinding is necessary but insufficient prep for your coding interview!I see a lot of posts here complaining that even after grinding hundreds of Leetcode questions they still failed the interview. This is a big waste of your effort and the result of ignorance about what the interview is testing. Here's some hard truths:\n\n1. Interviews are not testing your ability to solve a Leetcode problem. That is a *prerequisite*. The interviewer is looking for communication, problem solving, and collaboration skills. They want to see you fully comprehend the problem, anticipate edge cases, and clearly explain your thought process.\n2. You should be able to solve novel problems in interviews. *Especially for FAANG*. If you are competing with thousands of applicants for elite engineering roles, it's expected that you can solve problems that you have not seen during practice.\n3. Leetcode interviews may be an unfair interviewing methodology, but adequately talented and motivated candidates can consistently be successful in these interviews when they prepare properly.\n\nIf you're grinding hundreds of problems because you enjoy it, good for you! If you're doing it to succeed in interviews you need to change your strategy.\n\nStudy DSA and common problem topics. Practice weak spots and get to the point where you can solve new mediums consistently. Resources like Neetcode and Cracking the Coding Interview make it easier to solve new problems by recognizing patterns with less practice. Remember, it is possible (and expected for FAANG) for you have a strong enough grasp of all the basic Leetcode topics to solve new medium problems almost every time.\n\nAfter you have a mastery of solving new problems, then you need to master the skills the interviewer will really be judging you on.\n\nPractice solving problems without executing code. Comment your code. Write your own test cases. If you submit code and are surprised by an edge case, that would have been a negative mark in your interview. Practice speaking your thoughts out loud. **Literally speak out loud.** Practice doing all of this together in under 30 minutes.\n\nIf that's impossible for you then your odds of successfully interviewing for FAANG is low and you should seek out companies with interview processes that work better for you. Mastering these skills for easy problems is probably sufficient for most companies. I'm not trying to be an asshole here, but these companies are extremely competitive and the bar is high. Ignoring these hard truths leads to exasperation and failure. ",

    "raw": "How to get better at leetcode for interview prep so what you learn sticks with youRecently saw a post asking for leetcode tips so I thought maybe I'll share what my roadmap is to getting better.\n\nSo let's get right into it  \n  \nI would start with neetcode 150 (neetcode.io/practice). If you're using python and need to refresh your knowledge on Python syntax, neetcode has a cheat sheet (https://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/python-for-coding-interviews) you can use. Otherwise, whatever language you use, make sure you know the syntax. If you don't know which language to choose, or if your main purpose of doing leetcode is to get better at interviews, then I'd suggest Python for it's easy and concise syntax. I used to code in Java and switching to python made a huge difference.\n\nI would also recommend going over some basic DSA video on youtube and a video that covers big O notation. This shouldn't take you too long if you already have some background knowledge on these topics (maybe 2 days).\n\nAs for how to approach solving these questions...\n\nFirst, you want to target all the easy questions in each topic from neetcode 150 (from arrays and hashing all the way down to bit manipulation. Then do all the mediums, then all the hards.\n\nI've heard ppl say that when you go through the whole list the first time, you should not even attempt to code and just look at the at the solution and try to understand it. Do that with all 150 questions. Once you do that, then you can go over the whole list again but actually attempt the question. I personally never did this particular step. I can see how it'd be beneficial but time is also a precious resource. So if it's not necessary then there's no need to do it.\n\nNow when you actually attempt questions, try to do 2 questions per day (feel free to do more, I'd recommend max 5 questions per day to not overload your brain, but YMMV) and make sure you set a timer for 30 min for each question. This allows you to try to attempt the problem but not waste too much time on a single problem. There's no point trying to solve a problem for hours since that's a waste of time and time is of the essence. So look at neetcode's solution, look at the best 3-5 solutions in the leetcode discuss/solutions section, and learn from it. Upsolving is very underrated and should definitely be utilized when doing leetcode. For every problem you're not able to solve on your own, revisit it after 2-3 days (but max 1 week). I would suggest keeping track of all this information in some kind of spreadsheet or notion database. This youtube video (https://youtu.be/Xy2VokU7erM?si=Im6wctEUXwJ9Tfku) has a solid template you can use.\n\nOnce you're done neetcode 150, you're probably gonna notice that you're weak in some topics. Make a list of topics you wanna improve in, check (https://algo.monster/problems/stats) to see which algorithms are the most important to know, and re-order your list of algorithms you're weak at and study those topics deeply. You can either choose questions from the Neetcode All list or you can search for questions for particular DSA on leetcode.  \n  \nAfter this, you probably should be good to tackle interviews. An optional step to becoming even better is to start doing leetcode contests (weekly and bi-weekly). You can start off by doing virtual contests (which is basically leetcode contests from the previous weeks but you won't be scored on virtual contests) to get a feel of where you stand, and eventually start to do leetcode contests. Although there's no magic number to aim for in terms of your leetcode contest rating, if your goal is to do consistently well in interviews then I think 1700-1800 would be a decent target to aim for. This is, of course, assuming you don;'t cheat on the leetcode contests\n\nHope this helps!",

I coded it up and tested it within the time limit.\n\nFor the second question, I had seen something similar before and tried to use a greedy approach.\nNormally, I would have spent more time evaluating my solution, but felt under pressure and started coding.\nHowever, with about 10 minutes left, I realised my solution didn't pass an edge cases, the problem was similiar but different enough, but realised too late, and didn't have time to fix it.\nI'm so frustrated with myself, because the actual solution was even easier than the one I implemented!\n\n\n**Coding Round 2**:\n\nMy confidence was a bit shaken after the first round, but I decided to be a bit more cautious this time.\nFor the first question, I think I ate into the time for the second question, but was able to get an optimal solution, but needed a small hint.\n\nFor the second question, this was a bit tricky.

As of now there are many lists online Blind 75 ([https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)), Prashad's leetcode patterns ([https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)), curated list of problems from Elements of Programming.\n\nI aggregated all problems from those lists and tips/tricks from the books in one free platform. Solving problems on this platform will make you prepared for any coding interview at most of the big tech companies. For each problem, we have description, written explanation with time/space complexity. All problems are solved using 4 different programming languages ***C++, Java, JavaScript and Python***. For each problem we created a deep dive video going into details on how to solve the problem. As of this moment we have **17 categories with 200+ solved problems**.\n\nThe platform is meant to be used following 4 simple steps:\n\n1. Start with any of the categories, and go from easy to hard level problems (sorted order)\n2. Read the problem, see if you can do it on your own, read the explanations and watch the video\n3. Try related problems and continue solving the problem in the selected category\n4. Retention phase, after 3 weeks randomly select a problem from the category you have already completed, solved the problem in your head. Basically just go through the pattern you would use, read the explanation of the solution",

Moved to development following that. Got promoted to a Senior Engineer position 2 yrs back.\n\nI feel that in my tenure as Software Engineer, I haven't got the opportunity to solve many software engineering problems of diverse kinds. It was all same kind of problem and I mastered an approach/solution in the 1st couple of years and kept applying it whenever applicable.

To be extremely honest, till a few months back my entire language skill was in a proprietary coding language. I kept pushing myself in learning Object Oriented Design and Design Patterns, etc. I always considered those skills to be transferable across languages.\n\nVery recently I started thinking about the idea of switching jobs and started dreaming about having a high paying SDE position in a big company (maybe a FAANG). I started learning Modern JavaScript in the past couple of months so that I can use it to solve the coding interview problems. I came across job level descriptions in companies like Google, Facebook, etc. Based on the YOE solely, I could be applicable to an E5/L5 position in these companies.

Are you supposed to implement a REST API itself in LLD/machine coding round or it is okay if we build something using the main methods?\n2. If you are given a project from before, are you supposed to make it work by having a DB connection as well? And is it mandatory to have it deployed somewhere? If yes, then can you suggest some trial/free cloud infra where we can deploy them?\n3. In live coding round/LLD/machine coding, are you expected to connect to DB or use HashMap And stuff is generally enough?\n4. If it's not a machine coding round, how do you go about the LLD round? What amount of code should we write in it? Like whether all the classes have to implement end to end or only some?\n5. In LLD rounds, do we need to design the HLD first and get a buyout and then go for LLD? If that's the case, won't it leave us with less time for LLD?\n6. To develop REST APIs we need a lot of maven libs which we won't remember by heart right? Are we allowed to google in that case?\n7. How do you manage to hold yourself together in a machine coding round?\n\nNeed the community's help!  \nTIA.",

I have 5 YoE as an engineer and very comfortable with my language and basic data structures and algorithms. However, I didn’t take any formal comp sci courses nor have had really done much Leetcoding.  The advice I was given was to just focus primarily on BFS and DFS and then implement quicksort and merge sort.  So far, so good with the graph problems, but if I were to do the Blind 75 / Neetcode questions, I don’t think I have enough time at all.  Is Amazon a bit easier with their questions or should I ask for more prep time if I can get it and try to tackle the Blind 75/ Neetcode?\n\nI know about the system design and LP questions, and those should be easy for me but a bit worried about the Leetcode",

I managed to pass the Amazon OA, and I am getting scheduled for the virtual interview day and I want to prepare as much as I can. l am re-doing the Neetcode 150, and I got the most popular Amazon problems with the leetcode-bot on cscareers discord. For those of you that have gone through this, what type of questions do they usually ask? Since the ones on the OA were very different (at least in format) from the leetcode ones - is it usually more of a direct leetcode, or one of their OA-style problems. Also any suggestions on what the system design is like for backend SDE? Thank you in advance!!!",

The inputs are different than I expected. In one interview I was asked to unpack a JSON object into a dictionary and return in the structure of [`cust.name`](https://cust.name)`:value, cust.profession:value, cust.address.state:value,` [`cust.address.city`](https://cust.address.city)`:value`. In another interview, I was asked to design a error checking to take File as input and match and sort in Hashmap with some other few requirement using OOP in Java. In aother interview they asked me to to find something from the input DS which looks like this:  `{0:[(1,1),(2,1)], 1:[(3,1),(4,1)]}` and return 1 or 0 at the end based on some calculations.\n\nI feel like leetcode inputs are straighforward it is not enough given the OOP programming and weird inputs for SDE II interviews.

    "raw": "How I went from low-level startup to FAANG in 3 months. AKA, Interview Tips & Tricks# General Notes\n\nI have decided to make this Mega Post as a \"pay-it-forward\" to the community. There has been a lot of great (and dear lord some not-so-great) content I've found over the past 3 months that have made me landing the job possible. The whole time, I was hoping I could just have a one-stop-shop for interviewing with FAANG, though, and I just couldn't find the \"perfect\" one I was after. My goal is to create that in this post. Mostly, because if I want to do this all over again in the way distant future, I can just reference this and be good to go.\n\nI also want to mention that this is coming from the perspective of someone who has 6 years in the industry as a Mobile (Android) Engineer. Therefore, while I do firmly believe a majority of this information is good for ALL Software Engineers, this will probably be most useful for Mobile Devs (Especially the System Design section). Sorry, not sorry - Mobile is definitely lacking in terms of System Design help out there.\n\n# General Tips & Tricks (TL;DR, in a way)\n\n* **You will get out what you put into the process.** This is going to be a very difficult process for many. These jobs are HARD to get. Even for the most talented of engineers, there is a game to be played that isn't well-known, or learned, during the day-to-days of the job. The only way to make it through is to put in the work.\n* **If you only want FAANG for the money, I'd strongly encourage you to just... not.** Like I mentioned above, it's a lot of work. A lot of stress. A lot of time and effort, and in some cases money goes into these interviews. These companies have been known to burn people out quickly. FAANG is not for everyone, though most discourse you find makes you feel like a failure if you aren't going after FAANG, or able to get into one. You *can* get into a FAANG company while hating the job, but no job is worth doing if you hate it that much. In this economy, I get it. We've got bills to pay, right? But you can still pay your bills as a non-FAANG software engineer and coast your whole life, without having to kill yourself trying to get in at FAANG and keep your job there (especially at a time of mass layoffs). There's no shame in that.\n* **Coding is not everything. It's not even worth half of your score.** I think the biggest mistake I see people make is putting all of their eggs in the basket of LeetCode - finding the most optimal solution. It's important, sure, but it's not even close to the most important part. More on this later.\n* **Interviewing someone costs a TON of money.** They want to remove people from the process as quickly as they possibly can. Make sure to take pre-screenings seriously. Majority of cuts happen at this point.\n\n# Step 0: Resume\n\n* **You are the best person to write your resume.** Do not pay someone else to write it for you or help fix it. Sure, ask a friend to proofread it, compare it to others, but don't just copy and paste.\n* **Don't just use buzzwords.** Sure, algorithms are looking at resumes, but they are looking for \"Java\", \"Integrated Testing\", etc. They are NOT searching for \"spearheaded\", \"plethora\", etc.\n* **However, wording does still matter.** Saying something like, \"Drove cross-functional outcomes with UX designers, backend engineers, and iOS engineers to create a consistent and scalable user experience across various applications,\" is typically more impactful than, \"Worked on Project Name with a full-stack team.\"\n* **No special formatting.** Like I mentioned, there is a lot of non-humans looking at your resume. Make it easy for the bots to understand it. As a general rule of thumb, I would avoid multiple columns, having lots of whitespace characters, and special page breaks.\n* **Include the following sections: Language, Skills, Experience, Leadership & Certifications/Awards, Education. Optionally, About Me.**\n   * Languages and Skills should be HIGHLY scannable, with *no extra* buzzwords. Do NOT put proficiency levels. Let certifications provide proficiency levels, do not rate yourself.\n   * If you are early in your career, you can probably remove the \"Leadership & Certifications/Awards\" section, you probably won't have enough for it to be in its own section.\n   * After your first engineering job, do not include your GPA, or too many details about your education. They aren't going to care about your Capstone projects after you have had real world experience, keep it just to a sentence or two, or maybe consider cutting it completely - especially if you are moving past 1 page.\n   * About Me is weirdly controversial. Some will argue it's reason for them to not hire you - or additional ways for bias to be added into the mix. Others argue it's great for differentiating yourself from others. I have personally landed on the side of, if I need it for formatting reasons - to make it a full page, or make the second page worth while, I'll add it, otherwise, I'll omit it. Definitely be careful about what you put here, saying you enjoy watching Hockey is all fun and games, but saying \"I'll never miss a single Maple Leafs game\" is a bit dicey - may seem like your inflexible.\n* **Put a lot of thought into results.** Companies want to know the *impact* you've made, not what you've been assigned to do. Even if you don't have quantifiable things (i.e.: Increased revenue by 15%), it's still worth trying to think through what changed as a result of you doing X (i.e.: Generated a personalized user experience powered by X, and Y by doing ABC\"). Here, the impact you made was allowing users to have a personalized experience by working on feature ABC with data X and Y. Think creatively here - DO NOT MAKE UP STUFF, but expand your horizons of what a result is. Revenue increase, app store rating increase, quicker code reviews, improved team/client satisfaction, reduced bug reports, etc.\n* **Make sure your resume is targeting the job you WANT not the job you HAVE.** Another mistake I see people make is writing your resume with a focus on mid-level items because that is your current level, when you are trying to get Senior at the next company. You may not be a \"leader\" right now, but think about any leadership skills you've done as a mid-level that can be used to put you in a senior-level light. Again, do not make things up, but even if you've mentored a single person, or led a single feature, write that down.\n* **Make slight changes to your resume for each job you are applying to.** If you are a full-stack developer, but the job is looking for strictly backend. Highlight the backend work - maybe add more detail there, even. If you are an Android dev, and it is clear the company is looking for Jetpack Compose devs, make sure that is listed near the top - potentially even remove XML if you don't think it's necessary. Look at the job listing, and make sure you've hit on the majority of it in your resume. Resumes take time, hours even. If you find you've \"applied to hundreds, but haven't heard back from one\" ask if you've put in the time for that specific job. If the answer is no, do better.\"\n* **Avoid pronouns when describing your experiences.** Don't put \"I worked on project...\" just say \"Worked on...\"\n\n# Step 1: Interacting with Recruiters\n\n* **Have some goddamn empathy.** Look, finding a job is an incredibly stressful time in your life. For most of us, we are looking for a new job because we dislike our current ones for one reason or another, or maybe it's for a big move. Just stress on stress on stress. And I get it, right? They're recruiters - this is their *job* - they should be willing to get on the phone with you at all hours of the day because this is what they are getting paid to do! Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say you gotta bullshit them. I'm not sending giftcards, or thank you notes - I'm not singing their praises back to them. But have some understanding for another human being who has 100s of you trying to get in touch with them on the regular - while they are also figuring out how people should best fill out paperwork, apply for citizenship, look for new candidates, etc. ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS when it feels like there are 1000s of applicants for a single job. You don't have to be a suck-up, but dear god understand when they don't respond to you within a few minutes.\n* **Ask questions as early as possible.** Not only could this look good as it shows you are putting in the work, and not leaving it to the last second, but it also gives them time to respond to you.\n* **Figure out the best way to get in touch with them.** One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is that they assume you can only communicate by e-mail, or maybe some tool. Not everyone is built the same. Straight up ask them, \"What is the best way I can get in touch with you?\" I've had some recruiters prefer texting, some comments on a Google Doc, some email, and some others in between. Help THEM help YOU. Make it as easy for them to respond, and they will probably do so.\n* **Prepare for the meetings you will have with them during the interview process.** It seems kind of silly that you have to prepare even just to meet with recruiters, when you are already killing yourself to prepare for the actual interview, but it's quite critical, in my opinion. I'm not saying you have to spend hours preparing for this interview, but do you know the best time you are guaranteed an answer to your questions? That's right, face-to-face. If you are meeting right before the phone-screen, make sure you have looked into what the phone-screen is for that company and come with any questions you have about it. Moving to the on-site? Here's only a billion questions I have about that. Team Matching - boom, here's some concerns I have there too. Write questions down if you need to. These things can be nerve-wracking, or happen very quickly, make sure you are organized to get through them all.\n* **Remember, they are here to help you, not hurt you.** It may be quite obvious, but typically they get paid if you get the job. Don't be afraid to ask questions - even if you are think they are silly. They *want* you getting the job. They will answer as much as they are legally allowed to. Don't be afraid to use them as a resource, but also, make sure you don't inundate them either. It's best to ask 10 questions at once, rather than 1 question every other day. Context switching is not fun for them either.\n\n# Step 2: Coding Rounds\n\n**General Tips & Tricks**\n\n* **I said it before, I'll say it again, you will get out of this what you put into the process.** You will not learn anything doing it once a week. You will not retain that information if you look at a topic once a month. You must continuously run drill over and over and over again.\n* **Don't compare yourself to other LeetCoders.** People cheat, people have no lives, people are weird. It doesn't matter how others are doing, what their ranks are, etc. I never did a single competition. It doesn't matter. FAANG isn't reaching out to you because you are the #237 LeetCoder in the world.\n* **You gotta learn how to walk before you can run.** It is super discouraging when you start LeetCode for the first time, pick a random question, and then think it's completely mumbo jumbo with no idea how to solve it. In those moments, take a step back, figure out how to solve it - what is the pattern/algorithm/structure/etc - and try again later. You gotta learn it before you can ever try to solve them on your own.\n* **Don't spend more than an hour struggling to find an answer.** There are so many resources out there that say you'll never learn by looking up a solution. And, to be fair, there is some merit to that if you just glance at the solution and that's it. But if you actually take the time to look it up, think about each line of code, what it's doing, read the explanation, walk through examples, etc. It will be worth it. After a while, I would reduce this time. You know you best, if you know you won't get a solution, just move on.\n* **\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Getting an optimal solution working by the end is worth as little as 20% of the result.** If I could only pick one mistake I see people making, it is this. Engineers truly love seeing things as black-and-white as possible. Pass/Fail. No middle ground. They think if you get an optimal solution, they've immediately passed. That is not true at all. Sure, it's important, but you NEED to be able to talk about your thought process eloquently. You need to be able to discuss time and space complexities and tradeoffs between different approaches. You need to be able to walk through examples and bugfix on the spot. ALL of this matters. So many people miss 1 problem and think it's all over, or on the contrary, they know they did perfect on finding the optimal solution for the coding problems and are surprised they didn't get an offer. This notion is wildly incorrect. The way you come across in an interview matters a lot.\n\n**How Best To Prepare**\n\nThis particular section may be most helpful for people who struggle with LeetCode. For background, I took \"Algorithms and Data Structures\" in college, and failed the class. The only reason I didn't need to retake it is because a magical curve moved my grade from an F to a D, and that is technically enough to fill the required class. Safe to say, I knew almost nothing when I stared a few months back.\n\n* First thing I did, was PAY for LeetCode. You can either pay $35 a month for Leetcode Premium, or $13.25 a month if you pay for a full year upfront. I chose a full year. I definitely didn't need that, but I don't regret it either. As I've now accepted a role, I'm making way more than that. It was worth the upfront investment. The reason that is critical for people who don't know what they are doing is because they have courses meant to help you learn the concepts, not just rehash them. And also, you can see the Editorials for the problems which will go through various methods of solving each problem as well as time and space complexity analysis. As someone who didn't even understand the concept of time/space complexity this was worth every single goddamn penny.\n* Second thing I did, was the \"Learn\" courses found under the \"Explore\" tab. In this exact order, I did: Arrays 101, Array + String, Queue & Stack, Binary Tree, Recursion I, Recursion II, Graph, Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Heap, N-ary Tree, Trie, Comparator + Sorting.\n   * I highly recommend these courses. They do a great job at quickly explaining the topic, and then giving you problems related to it for you to do it on your own. Take for example, the Recursion II course. They introduce the topic of \"Backtracking\", and then have you immediately work on the N-Queens II problem to make sure you understand the concept. Then, just to be super-duper sure, they give you the template for such problems, before finally, throwing you into the deep end with 3 other Backtracking problems. Now, you can clearly see the name of the section, so you do get a clue that the problem is looking for a backtracking solution. Because of this, it's not the end-all-be-all. You won't get those clues in an interview, but it's great for learning patterns. I'm gonna drill into my head backtracking, backtracking, backtracking, and then what do you know? A few hours later, I know backtracking.\n* Third thing I did, was double down on some concepts I've seen people talking a lot about, \"Merge Intervals\" and \"Permutations\"\n* Fourth thing I did, was drill drill drill. For this, I recommend looking at curated lists with a little bit of everything. Some I found particularly useful were:\n   * Blind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit](https://leetcode.com/list/oizxjoit)\n   * Grind 169: [https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31](https://leetcode.com/list/rabvlt31)\n   * Grind 75: [https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1](https://leetcode.com/list/rab78cw1)\n   * Neetcode 150: [https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5](https://leetcode.com/list/rr2ss0g5)\n   * (I didn't need this one for mobile, but incase it's helpful for others) SQL 45: [https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts](https://leetcode.com/list/o2qifkts)\n\nOverall, it took about a month and a half just to \"learn\" the things. Then I spent the next month and half just finding different lists to randomly go off of to make sure I stayed on top of it all. By the end of it, Mediums looked easy, and Hards were also looking Easy half the time. But I did **PUT IN THE WORK.** I spent *hours* on this daily. Including weekends. I didn't have much of a life outside of this for a while. If you already know the basic concepts, I doubt you'll need to go quite as hard, but it is possible if you want it. You just *really* have to want it.\n\n# Step 3: System Design (Mobile-Heavy) Round\n\nI often see people talking about this one like it's the hardest of the bunch. Everyone is different, so it might very well be the most difficult for you, but I think a lot of it is it's just the most *unknown* of the bunch. Coding is easy. You just grind out LeetCode for a while, you're probs good. Behavioral - I get it, don't be weird. But system design? What are they even LOOKING for.\n\n* **Engineers love for things to be in black and white - pass / fail, but system design isn't.** Instead, it's a way for the company to figure out what level you are operating at. Are you able to think big-picture like a Senior+ candidate, or are you only able to figure out where the basics fit in? Have you thought about - and probably *seen* a lot of edge cases / error states / etc.? The more detail you can provide, the better.\n* **Talk about the tradeoffs.** \"There are several ways we can store this data. We could use sharedPreferences, or a SQL database like Room, we could also use a NoSQL database. I'm going to go with X because of ABC.\" The more you can talk about your tradeoffs and the real-world experiences you are able to bring alongside that discussion is what truly separates senior+ from mid-.\n* **It's a conversation, not a lesson.** I see so many people make the mistake of going in with a set structure. A general idea of what to talk about is great - requirements, high-level, low-level, issues. But, it's important to note that this interview is NOT black or white. They just sit there talking AT the interviewer instead of working WITH the interviewer.\n* **You want to drive, but don't be afraid of using your interviewer as the GPS.** Take a moment to stop every couple of minutes and just say something like, \"Would you like me to spend more time discussing my reasoning for picking X, or would you like me to move on?\" Or maybe even something like, \"I think the most exciting part to take a deep-dive on is A, but is there something else you were hoping to cover - maybe B or C?\"\n\n**How Best to Prepare for MOBILE System Design**\n\n* **Work on brand new codebases.** Whether it's during your 9-to-5, open-source, side-project, whatever, the more you are thinking about architecting a project from the ground-up the better.\n* **Learn how the big guys are doing things.** Meta has a podcast where they talk about how they've built things to focus on Open Source. Google has blogs on blogs on blogs. ALL of these companies - including non-FAANG like Airbnb - have blogs about why the chose to do something. Or what they did instead once they realized things were not going the way they wanted it to. They typically are talking about tradeoffs at SCALE which is very important for these interviews.\n* **Watch mock interviewers.** I found Alex Lementuev's channel to be a decent resource. There truly isn't a lot of mobile-specific system design support, but he provides some feedback at the end of the interview that is helpful. It's also nice just as a general overview of how these interviews are ran. There's a few others over on YouTube as well. I do truly wish there was something better I could recommend, but unlike Backend / Web, there just isn't a lot out there it seems.\n* **Do mock interviews yourself.** There are several services for this. Find one you like the most, and go for it. Especially if you are unsure about what is expected, or talking in front of people. The more practice you have, the better.\n\n# Step 4: Behavioral Round\n\n* **I wrote up a specific post with more detail on Behavioral here.** [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral\\_interviews\\_are\\_more\\_important\\_than\\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1eajg6j/behavioral_interviews_are_more_important_than_you/)\n* **Arguably one of the most important rounds for Software Engineers.** Whenever I see someone has been \"down-leveled\" or rejected, the first thing in my mind is *they messed up the behavioral part.* I am truly surprised at how little emphasis is put on this interview.\n* **This round is pivotal in determining which level you will be hired in at.** Just like your resume, you want to make sure your answers are showing impact at the level you are *wanting*, not the level you *have.* Looking for entry-level? You better show you are a good human being. Looking for mid-level? Make sure you highlight your ability to work with little oversight on your work. Senior? What impact are you having on your *team*? Staff+? What impact are you having on your *organization*?\n* **You cannot overprepare for this round.** You probably aren't spending as much time on this as you are LeetCode, but spend some time to really think about good examples in your job that are relevant to the position you are looking to get at the next company. Make sure you are thinking about the STAR method, and framing those examples accordingly. Also, for the love of god, *do not lie*. It is so easy to tell when people are making things up - don't think you are better than others at lying.\n* **Have an equal number of technical and leadership examples if you are looking at Senior+ jobs.** You are still trying for a *technical* leadership position. Don't forget the technical. But also, you are looking for the leadership side of things too. Be well-balanced, for every \"I mentored this person\" there should be a \"I had to walk back this architecture decision here\" kind of a thing.\n\n# Step 4: Team Matching\n\n* **See Step 1 above.** For real, be nice.\n* **Prepare to meet with Hiring Managers.** Similarly to preparing to meet with recruiters, you should also think about your meetings with HMs. This stage is all about finding out if this team is a good fit for you, and you are a good fit for them. What a good team for you looks like may be different than someone else. Think about what *you* need to thrive at work. You generally want to come up with questions for the HM that will help you figure out if the team is a good match for you or not.\n   * Maybe if being in the same office is important to you, you'd ask something like, \"Is the team all located in City X?\"\n   * Or if releasing products into the world is important you may ask something like, \"How often do you guys release updates?\"\n   * If you are motivated by promotions / title changes, you may be thinking about, \"What are the growth opportunities you see for this position?\"\n   * Nowadays, as the power is very much in employers hands, I would stay away from questions like, \"What is the work life balance\", \"What is the tech stack\", etc. unless those things are truly a make-or-break for you.\n* **It's not another interview, but it also kind of is nowadays.** There are way more people in team matching than it seems there are job openings. I've seen some people go from passing to match in 3 days, I've seen others go for 8+ months. You are competing against others, don't be rude. Ask good questions, be genuinely interested in the role. Take the first one you are even someone interested in.\n* **There is an element of luck to it no matter what you do.** We don't know what goes on behind the scenes. It could be that the person needs someone immediately - so they are only looking at candidates who already live in the area. Or maybe they do this one very specific thing in Rust, so they are only looking for people who mentioned that specific thing on their resume, etc. Embrace the craziness that is, try to find others in the same boat as you so you can laugh-cry about it all. Breathe in, breathe out, it will be okay.\n\n# Step 5: Offer and Negotiating\n\n* **You can negotiate often at FAANG, however, you must have data.** You can ask for a bonus of some kind if you are throwing away money to be there.

    "raw": "Microsoft Senior SWE Interview Experience (with offer)Here's a detailed breakdown of my recent interview experience with Microsoft. I hope it helps anyone preparing for a similar set of interviews!\n\n* **Microsoft Role:** Senior Software Engineer (Azure)\n* **Hiring Quota:** 5 spots available\n* **My Demographics:** White // Male // Millennial // 6 Years of Experience // US Citizen\n* **Current Role:** Staff SWE // Large startup // Fully remote\n* **Resume:** [https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/JyckGJ7/resume.jpg)\n* **Microsoft Offer:** Role: Senior SWE (L63) // Base: $176k // Signing Bonus: $15k // Stock: $120k over 4 years // Bonus: 0-30% // Fully remote\n\n# 05/04/2024 - Applied on website (found role on LinkedIn)\n\n# 05/16/2024 - Recruiter Email\n\nIncluded \\~20 questions. Questions were biographical/hr, background/experience, what you're looking for in your next role, and 2 role specific questions.\n\n# 06/18/2024 - Technical Screen\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (hiring manager)\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/) (domain/details were changed but problem was basically the same)\n* **How'd I do?** Fine. Didn't find an optimal solution. Barely found any real solution, tbh. Interviewer stepped in to help many times. I made the key insight to treat the data as a graph and I think that was required not to fail. I was very communicative and that's probably why I passed.\n\n# 07/01/2024 - Onsite Prep\n\n30 minute prep call with recruiter/scheduler.\n\n# 07/02/2024 - Onsite Rounds 1 & 2\n\nRound 1:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineer\n* **What?** 45 min. LeetCode, 15 min system design.\n* **Question?** [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/). Interviewer also expected it to be implemented in an object oriented manor.\n* **How'd I do?** I think I failed this one tbh and it got me down-leveled from 64 -> 63. I gave a solution involving binary search/inserts over a sorted list. Correct answer is min/max heap. It's a commonly known problem and I think the interviewer basically expected me to know it. Positive feedback was that I communicated well and structured the interface well, even if implementation was suboptimal.\n\nRound 2:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 1hr. LeetCode\n* **Question?** [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)\n* **How'd I do?** Perfect. I coincidentally did this one the day before, and I believe I had more experience than the interviewer.\n\n# 07/03/2024 - Onsite Rounds 3 & 4\n\nRound 3:\n\n* **Who?** Senior Engineer\n* **What?** 30 min. LeetCode, 30 min system design.\n* **Question?** Basically create a class that lets you add/remove nodes from a tree. Started with coding, then asked to convert to distributed system.\n* **How'd I do?** Very positive feedback on the coding problem (super simple problem, but I think my communication went a long way). Fine feedback on the system design. Basically just had a client, load balancer, service, and database lol.\n\nRound 4:\n\n* **Who?** Principal Engineering Manager (different from tech screen)\n* **What?** 15 min. technical/background discussion, 45. min system design.\n* **Question?**  Pretty challenging question about creating a aggregating all data for all tenants in Azure. The hard part is not making too many requests to any tenant/subscription at once (or else you'll rate limit the customer).\n* **How'd I do?** Okay. Was caught off guard since the recruiter told me this round would be all experience/culture. The solution is to query each tenant and add their subscriptions to a queue, then for each subscription in the queue add all their resources to another queue, then for each of those get the data. I tried some sort of Apache Spark scheduling thing to balance between tenants the interviewer didn't like. The interviewer told me the correct answer is to re-enqueue a job every time you hit a rate limit (with some jitter to prevent bunching). I didn't finish in time, but the interviewer gave me an extra hour to finish the whiteboard design and snapshotted it after.\n\n# 07/08/2024 - Initial Offer\n\nNegotiations ongoing.\n\n# 07/15/2024 - Final Offer\n\nOffered $194k base, and I declined the offer.\n\n# LC Stats\n\nFrom Jan 2024 when I started practicing until the day of the first onsite.\n\n* 2.2 problems per day\n* 31 active days\n* 68 solved problems\n* 24 easy (35%)\n* 44 medium (65%)\n* 0 hard (0%)\n* 80 attempts\n* 12 retries\n* 57.51% avg runtime\n* 47.19% avg memory\n* 0:30:20 avg problem\n* 1:15:50 avg day\n* 40:26:48 total time\n\n# My Top Resources\n\n* **LC Problem Selection:** [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)\n* **LC Solutions**: [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode)\n* **System Design Subjects:** [Jordan has no life Systems Design 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwt09KXDH94&list=PLjTveVh7FakLdTmm42TMxbN8PvVn5g4KJ&pp=iAQB)\n* **System Design Strategy:** [Hello Interview: System Design Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdPyoO6aXI&list=PL5q3E8eRUieWtYLmRU3z94-vGRcwKr9tM&pp=iAQB), [Hello Interview: Learn System Design in a Hurry](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* **Other:** [Senior Engineer's Guide To Microsoft's Interview Process and Questions](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/microsoft),",

    "raw": "My Google Interview ExperienceA few months back, I had my off-campus Google interview for the SWE role. I had like a month to prepare when I received the very first email. I asked some Googlers about their interview experiences and everyone, including on the internet mentioned that Graph and DP are the most asked topics in Google. I solved a lot of problems on DP, graphs, though I focused on other topics as well.\n\nIn first round, I was asked a question on graph. I was able to solve the warm-up as well as follow-up problem. The round went well. In the second round, I was given a 1-D array and solved the problem using two pointers. In the follow-up question, I first gave DP solution, then came up with the most optimal one after a hint given by the interviewer, which was again a two pointers solution.\n\nFew days later, I got call for the final round. This time I was expecting some good DP question. But in this round, I was given two strings. I started with a recursive solution and ended up with a linear solution in the last minute (again using two pointers), but I had no time left to code. I received rejection after few days.\n\nOne thing I learned from this experience is that we should go for an interview open-minded and never expect anything particular from the interview. Just because it's an XYZ company, does not mean it'll ask some advanced problems that you cannot think of under pressure. **It's not about the topic, it's about the concepts and thier implementations.**",

    "raw": "Meta E4 Onsite: RejectedIt's been a long road, but my Meta interview process finally came to an end today. Got the call 2 hours after completing the final interview that I wouldn't be moving forward.\n\nEven though I didn't pass, tbh I'm really proud of how far I've come. When the recruiter reached out to me in October, I hadn't interviewed in over 4 years and had forgotten all my DSA knowledge. Also knew nothing about system design.\n\nFor the next 2 months, I grinded Neetcode Blind 75 like crazy every day and it really paid off. Had my phone screen in January and couldn't believe it when I passed. Started grinding system design for 2-3 hours every single day to ramp up for the onsite as fast as possible. Never did SD before so this was all new to me. Did probably 30 peer mocks using Pramp and Exponent, as well as HelloInterview where I got really helpful feedback from real Meta interviewers.\n\nFinally had my onsite this week - 2 coding, 1 SD, 1 behavioral. I felt like I rocked the coding interviews, all thanks to Neetcode so was really happy about that. SD was definitely my weakest area as this was my first time doing it, feel like I didn't pass that one. Behavioral went good I thought.\n\nUltimately I think I had a chance, but since hiring is so competitive these days, and I've heard Meta is pausing E4 hiring (not sure if that's true), any weaknesses I had probably got magnified tenfold. It is what it is, at least I can relax now.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Neetcode is a national treasure and needs to be protected at all costs. What makes him great is not his ability to solve problems, but his ability to explain and break down problems, which I think is what interviewers actually value\n* Unless you're a genius, it is physically not possible to learn all of System Design in 1 month. This is because it's not enough to just study the basics, you need to go over several case studies so you're familiar with all types of systems, which is extremely time-consuming\n* Try as much as possible to do mocks with people who are better than you or have actually interviewed people before. They will give you the harsh feedback that is required to get better\n\nEdit: Just came across my [post from 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17o0l8v/how_to_approach_blind_75/). Saying I've come a long way is an understatement haha",

    "raw": "Messed up my Google interview, what do I doGoogle SWE has been my dream job and when the recruiter reached out, I was ecstatic. I had only 3ish weeks to prepare and it was my first interview in 3 years so I had forgotten everything.\n\nI worked my ass off. I studied so much, all the time while juggling personal issues. I couldn't believe how much I had actually studied with such less time, DP, Greedy, all the data structures, backtracking, etc. Interview rolls around and I'm nervous as heck, expecting some hard tree/graph question. I got a simple af array/string question. You will not believe how excruciatingly I fucked up. I would've done this in 2 mins, but I stuttered and stammered for 45 fucking minutes. A fucking array question with a single for loop. Finnally hobbled to the finish line, with complete, optimised, working code and the time was up and the interview ended and then I laughed before I cried. I almost had a fucking panic attack in the middle of the interview with sweat dripping and hands shaking. I am so embarrassed and bummed out. The follow up question, I found out, was something I knew how to do easily as well. Ugh.\n\n\nAnyways, can you folks tell me about the times you messed up your interviews?

    "raw": "My Attempt at a Comprehensive Interview Study Guide (WIP)# Mental Health/Outlook\n\nI see posts of motivation/discipline a ton of this forum - \"I don't want to do this/I can't make myself study/This is bullshit\"... etc.\n\nI totally get it. We feel like this is an arms race and studying for interviews is a job in and of itself.\n\nReal talk though - this is how it is. This is the reality. You can rage against it, try and change it over the long term, or accept it. If you want a good job, the third option will get you there, and hopefully allow you to be in a position to change this when you become an exec/high level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  \ncourage to change the things I can,  \nand wisdom to know the difference.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer#cite_note-FRS-1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(replace god with \"The Universe\", \"Nature\", \"Dog\")\n\nI've been reading a ton of stoic literature lately, and it's made a big difference in my overall attitude and demeanor. If you didn't do any of the studying, I'd recommend picking up some of these, as I consider them life changing.\n\n[Daily Stoic](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance-ebook/dp/B01HNJIJB2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5YVB18WV2IM5&keywords=daily+stoic&qid=1641994555&sprefix=daily+stoic%2Caps%2C60&sr=8-1)\n\n[The War of Art](https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+war+of+art&qid=1641994590&sprefix=the+war+of%2Caps%2C58&sr=8-1)\n\n[The Obstacle is the Way](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=obstacle+is+the+way+book&qid=1641994576&sprefix=obstacle+is+%2Caps%2C55&sr=8-1)\n\n[The Ego is the Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ego+is+the+enemy&qid=1641994607&sprefix=ego+is+the%2Caps%2C51&sr=8-1)\n\nGet a therapist you can talk to at least once a week to once every 2 weeks.\n\n# Motivation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Motivation is often found on the other side of the work, not the other way around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet's it's own little section.

We all struggle with it, and there are good days and bad. *Motivation isn't the spark that starts the fire - YOU start the fire with discipline, consistency, and scheduling/process, and then motivation comes and warms itself by the flames.* \n\nIf this sounds like \"motivational\" bullshit, :shrug:, I'm a massive procrastinator, and my therapist telling me that was an eye opener.\n\n# Scheduling/Processes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart your day with a morning routine that involves scheduling your day out. Plan it out, down to the half hour if it helps (aka by pomodoro sessions). Your plan will go to shit; it will have disruptions; it will go off course. That's fine. That's life. With a schedule, all that means is that you can plan to take time from somewhere else or drop something.\n\nJust because your plan/schedule won't be intact because life happens doesn't mean you don't bother with it; it means that you have a process or framework in place for dealing with interruptions and derailings when they happen.\n\n# Leetcode\n\nGet Leetcode premium if you can afford it, don't stress if you can't.\n\nleetcode/coding interviews are all about pattern recognition and recall. I (and many others) have recognized the value of pattern based studying.\n\n**What to Study**\n\n[This site](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) breaks down by pattern. My recommendation is to go pattern by pattern, easy through hard on the pattern (or just easy through medium if you want). Once you've completed that pattern, move on to the next. If you note a weakness on a particular pattern, make a note of that, but move on. Once a week or so, go through and do a question from each pattern section for recall and to keep things fresh.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Use Sean Prashad's leetcode pattern list\n* Go pattern by pattern\n   * within a pattern, go easy -> hard\n* Set a day a week to review previous patterns\n   * picking questions at random OR\n   * Pick related questions from questions you've already solved\n\n**Individual Session strategy**\n\nNow that you have an overarching strategy, let's talk individual sessions.\n\nI like the pomodoro method - it makes starting easy (\"I only have to do 25 mins of work\") and also aligns pretty well with how long you should be spending on any one problem. \n\nTime Strategy:\n\n* Spend 1 pomodoro session (pomodoro 25 mins working) attempting the problem\n   * *If the pattern is completely new, or you literally have no idea what to do, don't waste the session staring at your screen, go to the solution*\n* HARD STOP after 25 minutes and rest (pomodoro 5 min rest)\n* Spend the next pomodoro session reviewing and really grokking the concept (not memorizing the code)\n   * during this session attempt to reimplement the now known solution's concept from memory\n* Move on\n* Never spend hours on the same problem, it is generally a waste of time (it's one of many potential problems you could be given, so there's an opportunity cost there)\n\nFramework for solving (WIP, would love input on making this more formal/better)\n\n* Ensure you read the problem and understand the constraints fully (ask clarifying questions)\n* Work through the given example Intuitively \n* Work through a brute force understanding time and space complexity\n* Run through some edge cases and note potential common pitfalls (common edge cases/pitfalls will present themselves as you work with patterns, eg. for array problems with ints, empty array, single element, handling first/last elements properly in your iteration, etc)\n   * Be prepared to code that BF if you're running out of time\n* Optimize (what would a better/optimal time complexity Look like)\n* Work through examples of the optimal solution and code it up\n* With both brute force and optimal solutions, psuedo code of the algorithm can help clarify intent for you and the interviewer, as well as give you an outline to follow when you start coding. Skipping this step is a great way to forget the big picture when you start implementing the details in the code. *Always having a comment block in your code that you're using a scratch, and write some pseudo code algorithms there that you can and the interviewer both can refer back to if you start rabbit holing. Do not delete things from here.*\n\n*In the beginning, getting a good understanding of the common patterns you'll see + a breadth of patterns is hugely important.*\n\n# System Design\n\n[System Design Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=system+design+interview&qid=1641993747&sprefix=system+design%2Caps%2C58&sr=8-1) is a very solid book\n\nLinkth checking out is [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) on educative (might want to splurge for a subscription because I recommend another course)\n\n[Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=designing+data-intensive+applications&qid=1641993870&sprefix=designing%2Caps%2C63&sr=8-1) is the holy grail, but very dense and doesn't target the interview. You should read it though, as it covers everything plus more that a system design interview could ever entail. I cannot recommend this book enough - it's so frigging cool and interesting, and resparked a love of learning about programming I had lost after years of building APIs and writing boring, high level code.\n\nAlso check out the [system design primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) on github\n\n# Behavioral\n\nI'm just starting here, since I'm least worried about this section (which might be a mistake)\n\n[Grokking the Behavioral Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview) is my only resource so far\n\nas well as Amazon Leadership Principle stuff which you can google for example questions\n\nI would attempt to write out and rehearse answers to these questions, just to help bring examples to the front of your mind so you're not stammering through or spending a ton of time trying to think of examples.\n\nGeneral Strategy\n\nI'm weakest at Leetcode, so I've been dedicating more time to it. What you need to spend the most on is something you'll have to figure out, but as a general recommendation I'd try to do a 1-1-2/3 ratio at least of studying\n\nE.g - If you have 2 hours a day to study, do \n\n* 2 hours of leetcode 3 times a week\n* 1 hour LC / 1 hour SD once a week\n* and 1 hour LC / 1 hr behavioral once a week\n* If you have more time, try and fit 2-3 LC sessions a day (1 hour sessions, \\[30 mins attempt, 30 mins review\\] and 1 SD / 1 Behavioral a day or 2-3 LC/1SD day one and 2-3LC/1Behavioval day two and repeat.\n\n# Pratice\nI’ve been using [pramp](https://www.pramp.com/invt/Q6vLplwXMAcyzrLjg0rO) and it’s been pretty amazing. I’d start early in the process, since in my experience so far doing this in front of someone is it’s own skillset (made easier of course if you have skill in LC/SD/Talking), and needs to be practiced. \n\nYou also get to play both sides of the table, and see people way better and worse than you, which can lead to insight. \n\nDo this!\n\n# Other resources\n\n[Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/) is pretty great\n\n[Neetcode on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_mYaQAE6-71rjSN6CeCA-g) for explanations\n\n[Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw) is an amazing teacher for concepts\n\n[William fiset](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8yeTczadqdARzQUp29PJw) has awesome videos on common DS, especially graphs and trees\n\n# Social\n\nThere are a ton of discords and whatsapp groups and more you can join. I never did, but many swear by them.\n\nAlso chat with me about it! It's tough work and having someone to keep up with about it makes it seem less heavy, and can help to motivate you!",

I answered almost 90% of the questions correctly regarding python, deep learning, AI etc. \n\nNow this is a local company and has a set of very popular intelligence questions they ask everyone. A few of my friends that were interviewed there got asked the same questions each time so I knew. \n\nOne of these is: 'what's the angle between two hands of a clock at 3:15'. I even had the answer to this memorized, let alone the procedure. Obviously I didn't want the recruiter knowing this, so I did act a little confused at first before solving it. But apparently he caught on to it, because he then asked me to calculate the angle at 5:30. Because of this unexpected follow up and the interview pressure, my mind completely went blank. I couldn't even picture how 5:30 looks on the clock. I did reach the solution (i.e. 15 deg) but with a lot of help from the interviewer. He asked me to calculate the angle for 7:25 afterwards, for which I couldn't come up with anything even after thinking for like 5-6mins. \n\nHe'd figured out that I had the answer memorized, cause he kept saying during the follow up questions that, 'how did you solve the 3:15 one so easily? Use the same technique for this one as well, it's simple.'\n\nI felt so stupid for not practicing a general method for solving a question of this nature.

Not asking enough questions / making assumptions\n\nAs soon as you get the question you should be asking a ton of questions **out loud.** Never make any assumptions about how you should be solving the problem.\n\nExamples of mistakes I've seen:\n\n1. Insisting we need to handle **X** use case for a user instead of asking/collaborating on if we *should*\n2. Assuming we don't need to handle things like negative numbers, bad users, etc\n\n# 2. Over-optimizing / spending too much time on one question\n\nI've heard many people say things like, \"I answered the question perfectly!! Why didn't I get the job?\" It's probably because the interviewer actually had 3 questions lined up for you but you spent way too much time on the first one. \n\nExamples of mistakes I've seen:\n\n1. Continuing to push for the most optimal solution even when your interviewer says the one you have now is ok\n2. Optimizing for certain use cases before asking your interviewer if it's even important\n3. Going down unnecessary rabbit holes (e.g. space optimization) when the interviewer never deemed it necessary\n\n# 3. Not considering the context of the code\n\nHow is this code going to be used? You're not in a black box anymore (LeetCode, school assignments, etc). You're interviewing for a company that writes code that actual humans use. How can you treat the interview like you're doing work for real users?\n\nExamples of mistakes I've seen:\n\n1. Ignoring scale that this problem might be used for\n2. Ignoring the users for the code (is it being run by bots in the background, is it a public API?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point we know you're pretty good at solving problems (if you made it this far you've already passed a difficult take home assessment).

Being in my fourth year of university, where intern questions are typically expected to be basic. However, the questions posed were very difficult, and I stumbled on almost all of them. The first interviewer concluded the session midway, asking if I had any questions, suggesting that we should wrap up.\n\nFortunately, the second interviewer joined the conversation, offering me another chance. This time, the focus shifted to my previous internship experience and the technologies I had used. I seized this opportunity to explain everything in good detail, as it aligned with my strong familiarity. This served as my final attempt to showcase my knowledge and experience, and to my relief, I answered all the questions by the second interviewer perfectly.\n\nDespite this, I don't have a good feeling about the outcome, and I am genuinely disappointed in myself. Despite everything going so smoothly in the previous stages, I feel that I faltered in the final round.",

I couldn't figure out how to solve this.\n\nInitially I thought this to be a sliding window problem but I cannot come up with a solution using that pattern. \n\nIs there something in this problem that hints at the pattern that can be applied?  I think I probably lack practice to see the trick here.\n\nAny help would be appreciated here. Thanks :)\n\n",

    "raw": "5 YOE Senior ML Systems SWE 8 month job hunting experience, approx 30 apps sent, 9 onsites, 2 offersHey everyone, this post is a detailed summarized experience of my job hunt this year started in January and just ended in late July in the SF Bay Area of USA. It will touch on the end-to-end application process with various companies as well as the preparation and interviewing experience.\n\nI know this will not be a reflection for majority of you, and I recognize that I was extremely privileged to even have the opportunities to have these many interviews. None the less, I still believe the experiences I had would be helpful for anyone that want more data points or would want to know what exactly has been going on.\n\n# Applications and Processes Overview\n\n## My background\n\nMy background consists of 5 years of experience in ML systems mostly in the area of self-driving and more specifically model development and model training. I currently reside in the SF Bay area on a H1B visa. The highlights of my background are as followed to even have the opportunities that I was given.\n\n* Graduated from University of Waterloo\n* Worked at Nvidia for 2 years\n* Worked at self-driving start up for 3 years\n* Have blog posts of my work published\n\nI personally believe that having such achievements as well as background is really necessary in this job market unfortunately. It did seem like that since I had a company like Nvidia on my resume, I had a lot of reach outs from recruiters. In a sense, it felt like what people feel was true; to get the opportunities now, you need to have some form of \"prestige\" to show for it.\n\n## Applications\n\nMost of my applications were not from me applying but rather responding to recruiter reach outs. I was also particularly picky with regards to where I wanted to work. I only responded to recruiters where the company itself was well known and well-funded or they are big tech companies or quant firms IF they are from inhouse recruiters.\n\nI only responded to a few 3rd party recruiters if they were recruiting for a company, I was particularly interested in. I also tried to avoid responding to recruiters from self-driving companies later on as I wanted to leave the self-driving industry.\n\nIn terms of sending out applications, I barely had any success. The only two companies that responded to my application were Waymo and Anthropic.\n\nFor referrals, they were also not really helpful, the only company that I got an interview from with referrals was OpenAI. Even referrals from my former manager and coworkers at Nvidia (where I left on good terms) did not land me reach outs.\n\n## Interviews\n\nHere were the companies I had the chance to interview for.\n\nApplied Intuition (onsite), Waymo, Ghost Autonomy (onsite), Anyscale (onsite), OpenAI, Zoox (declined onsite due to wanting to leave self-driving), Meta (declined onsite due to down level because of YoE [min 6])\n\nTook 2 months break\n\nPlaid (onsite), Optiver, Glean (onsite), Figma (onsite), LinkedIn (onsite), Anthropic, Adept, Roblox (onsite), Together AI, Databricks(onsite)\n\nFor each set of the applications, I only got 1 offer each.\n\n# Interview Details\n\nHere I will go into details about the interview types I had as well as what I learned from them and what to be aware of. Note for all of the companies, I was interviewing with an expectation of a senior role.\n\nUsually for most companies, it starts off with a recruiter screen followed by a phone screen. Later it would be the onsite loop consisting of 3 to 6 interviews depending on the company.\n\n## Recruiter screening\n\nRecruiter screens are really straight forward. Basically, just chat about your background as well as what you are interested in and your future career goals. The only time I would not move forward from a recruiter screening is if I am requesting for a role that they do not have. Most of the time, it would be them trying to pitch me the role itself and getting me to interview.\n\n## Online Assessments\n\nOnly company that required an online assessment was Anthropic. It was through codesignals and it was the industrial screening one where you have a 4 parts question, and you would need to answer each part before proceeding. Afterwards, you would get a score out of 600. Personally, myself I was able to get that score without an issue, I do not know what the cutoff would be, but I would imagine you would probably have to score perfect to move on due to how competitive it is.\n\nThe tip for this OA is to just code as fast as possible, time complexity isn't even taken into account.\n\n## Phone Screening\n\nMost phone screens I had were either leetcode or general programming questions. Companies now a days would ask multi-part questions (2 to 4) or just a hard straight up to be solved in 45 minutes to 1 hour. Some companies (Waymo, Anthropic, Optiver, Together AI) would ask you domain specific questions instead of general programming or would mix general programming with domain specific. Most companies would expect my code to run, only companies that didn't were Meta and LinkedIn where I would have to step through the code line by line with a given example.\n\nIt feels like for phone screening, the expectation is for all the questions to be answered as optimally as possible. Companies where I was not able to ace the question itself would lead to a rejection.\n\n## Hiring Manager Screening\n\nThis interview would be with your potential hiring manager, although not all companies did this (IE LinkedIn and Meta). I initially underestimated the impact of this screening until I was rejected at this stage for the top GenAI companies. From here I realize it is important to not only describe your work experience in detail BUT ALSO tailor your experience to what they are looking for. What helped me later on was to ask them directly what the type of experiences are they are looking for as well as problems and projects they are tackling. For this you would really need to play to your strengths and don't try to BS anything, they can easily pick it up.\n\n## Onsite Coding\n\nMost of the company's onsite coding was usually of either same or higher difficulty than the phone screening. Most companies would also have 1 to 2 of them. The content and expectations were relatively the same, multi part leetcode or situation programming questions varying from medium to hard difficulty. However, one thing that I did notice is that no matter how well you do on onsite coding, it would not really propel your application if you were weak in others. Almost all the onsite I have aced my coding interview or even got strong yes (from recruiter feedback) but would still receive a rejection if there were weakness elsewhere on my onsite loop.\n\nBasically, the minimum expectation for you for coding is to ace it from my experience, but even being better than acing it (IE you found additional edge cases or situations) would not propel your application.\n\n## Traditional System Design\n\nThis is where I am personally weaker at since I do not really deal with traditional data intensive systems. For most of the interviews, I would struggle here and would lead to a rejection. It did feel like for L5 level, they would expect you to have some sort of experience at least working with the system you have proposed. They drilled my experience here both in depth and also broadly to ensure all the bases were covered. This (and ML System Design below) would be the interviews that would tank my application if I did not do well no matter how good the other rounds go.\n\nThe questions they themselves asked were usually related to the product of the company though, so reading their blog and see how they tackled it can help, but again they would also probe you into parts with expectation of you having some in depth experience and see if you can make a decision with regards to the tradeoffs of proposals.\n\nAnother issue with this being very open ended is that it's hard to tell if the design that you came up with is the expectation of L4 or L5, not even in terms of detail but in terms of solution also as a solution that L4 would propose can be drastically different than from what an L5 would propose. The only way you would know is if you can receive feedback from it.\n\n## ML System Design (Data)\n\nThis part although I did not have many hands on experience, it felt like it was fairly straight forward. To me, it seems like any online data focused ML system design falls into one of the 3 categories:\n\n* Straight model request (IE ChatGPT)\n* Retrieval of information (IE Fraud systems)\n* Recommendation Systems (IE FB front page)\n\nIt was also expected for me to talk about the features themselves as well as solve issues that are relating to either the latency of the system or how to handle the data themselves in detail. They also wanted me to go over how training and deploying the model would work from a high-level perspective.\n\nHowever, I did get a few rejections due to this round specifically as I wasn't able to design the system handling data as well as they would want to.\n\n## ML System Design (Compute)\n\nThis part is basically the bread and butter of my career and would be something I can easily ace. The question here would be of these\n\n* Model Inference Systems\n* Distributed Training Systems\n\nThe expectation of these is basically to know how they work in detail as well as any caveats. There was also an expectation for you to be up to date with State of the Art such as knowing how LoRA works, or FSDP and such.\n\nSome other topics to know under this domain would be: QAT, Pruning, Mixed or Lower precision training/inferencing, Model parallelism, Data parallelism, Remote data loading and processing, XLA/TRT and other model compiler/optimizer technologies\n\n## ML System domain knowledge\n\nThis type of interview usually consists of half coding and half question and answers. For the coding part, it would be something akin to debug a model training or write a training loop.\n\nThe domain questions would be stuff as to how to debug training or inference performance, knowledge of hardware systems and how they accelerate training or inference, how to debug models and see if they were implemented correctly from a high level, and knowledge of specific frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch or Jax.\n\nFor this, it felt like the expectation is that the coding part have to be completed, and the question-and-answer part should show a strong understanding of the domain itself.\n\n## Presentation\n\nFor this, you are expected to have a slide deck to present a past project you have done. It should show sufficient scope for your level as well as technical details and impact. the interviewer usually would be of someone that have background knowledge of your presentation also and they will ask probing questions to ensure what you are presenting is something you do have hands on experience with.\n\nFor this, I usually pick a project that have gotten me promoted as I know the project well in detail as well as how it was able to be impactful and successful.\n\n## Behavorial / All Around\n\nThis interview is also something to not underestimate. For me, usually it was done by a manager that was not even in the org I was applying for. It felt like the expectation was to show how you handle situations in the past as well as being able to communicate your technical knowledge to someone that don't have the technical backgrounds for.\n\nTypical questions they would ask would be akin to anything about your most successful project to failures. They would also ask how you would do some projects differently. One thing that some companies would ask can be directly related to the company culture themselves. It's best to think about the potential questions they would ask beforehand and come up with a script.\n\n## MISC\n\nSome other type of rounds I also experienced were OOP coding, debugging, and in person projects (Ie you do a mini project onsite with interviewer supervision).\n\n# Interview Preparation\n\nFor preparation of this cycle, I really didn't spend that much time, it was more so I was both preparing and also interviewing. At the beginning, I would apply to throw away companies to practice too. Later on, I would only apply to companies I know I would accept an offer from or I would at least want to know what's going on side at those companies.\n\n## Coding/Leetcode\n\nMy leetcode stat were as followed\n\n* 226 questions solved\n* 44 Easy\n* 151 Medium\n* 31 Hard\n\nI also did not participate in any contests whatsoever. I started with the blind 75 list then moved onto the grind 75 list but expanded to cover all 169 questions. I also did questions for specific companies that I was interviewing for if those questions exist.\n\nI started doing interviews after finishing about 50 or so questions from the blind 75 list and did more along the way like 2 to 4 questions a day for few days every week.\n\nFor the questions themselves, I would attempt to solve them and have solved them 90% of the time without looking at the solutions. If I had to look at the solutions, I would write up a postmortem with regards to why I wasn't able to come up with the solution, what the intuition for the solution really required, and how I can even come up with such intuition.\n\nFor all the question I try to solve on leetcode, I would write up a few sentences or paragraphs with regards to the intuition I would need to come up with. For some questions, I would also even try to come up with how to come up with such intuition from first principles (Ie finding a loop in a linked list).\n\nMy mindset when it comes to the interviews in general is that it is highly unlikely I would be doing a question that I have seen before, but I would want to at least have the confidence that I have the necessary knowledge and come up with the intuition to solve it.\n\nFor coding out the solutions, I also pick up my preferred method of approach. This ensures that I can type out the solution fast as interviews expect you to solve 2+ questions in a 45-minute span. For example, if I need to solve a tree question, I usually go towards inorder traversal and recursive DFS. For anything that needs BFS, I would use layer wise BFS. Anything that involves a 2D plane, I would use vectors. Questions that require topological sort I would use Kahn's algorithm.\n\n## System Design (and ML System Design)\n\nFor this, I read parts of Alex Xu's system design book as well I am still trying to finish DDIA. I also used educative.io and watched Jordan has no life's YouTube channel. However, what I notice about system design is that you have to also practice it like leetcode.\n\nFor ML system design, I read Chip Huyen's book on Designing ML systems.\n\nFor practice, I would use Figjam by Figma on my desktop and iPad simultaneously to both type and draw stuff out. The questions I would do are stuff I would come up at random such as Design a smart queue system for sneaker drops or Design Credit card fraud system. I would then review my design with a friend that would conduct system design interviews for their feedback.\n\nMy mindset for system design interview would usually be play to my strength and my background and do admit if I don't know or don't have hands on experience with something. The one part I realize with interviewers is that they would want to know what you actually know and can work on, as my interviewer would usually be someone that had hands on experience designing their systems themselves.\n\n## Presentation\n\nFor presentations, it was simple. I would pick a project that got me promoted and then create a slide deck describing the project. I would also do a dry run or two with my friends to get their feedback to ensure both the slide deck as well as my own presentation sounded good.\n\n## Behavior Interview\n\nFor this, I would research the company's culture in detail and come up with specific questions that can tie to their culture and create responses to those. I would also think about what potential questions interviewers would ask typically and come up with specific responses and examples for this. I personally did not use any STAR system or anything, but I did structure my answer both in crucial detail and made sure they would be akin to the experience required for L5 engineers.\n\n## ML Domain\n\nFor this it is kind of hard to prepare, but I would always ask my coworkers that are working on interesting projects or anything SOTA to describe me how it works. I would also check and see what topics are SOTA and then research and read about it either in papers or through blog posts and YouTube videos to ensure I get a good understanding of it.\n\n# Mindset\n\nFor this section, I want to also talk about the necessary mindset and just overall challenges through this cycle.\n\nHonestly when I entered into this interview cycle, I did not expect it to take this long, and I already have a feeling that with my background, it would be easier. In a sense I was right, the background I had did get me interviews easily, but passing them was just as hard. It felt like you had to be perfect to land a job right now, especially in my case when I am only aiming for top companies and startups. This really made it stressful as in my mind, there was no room for any error and that I have to come in and do perfectly.\n\nWhat helped me through this was definitely treat it as competitive as possible, like you're playing a competitive sport. After every interview, I would sit down and reflect how it went both the good and bad. And if there was somewhere that went bad, I would think about how I would approach it better when I had to face it next time. I would write all these things in a notebook and review it time to time to ensure I don't repeat the same issues again.\n\nAnother thing was I was rarely caught by surprise between how I felt how the interview went and how the results were. If I felt like the interview went poorly, it would always end up in a rejection later on.\n\nWhat I also experienced is that for companies, when you get rejected on the onsite round, recruiters were willing to give you feedback. I was fortunately that a few of them were able to give me detailed feedback (one even read the entire review packet for me) to understand where I was lacking and where I am improving. However, that was something I saw as a generosity from them rather than an expectation. I would try to ensure we are still connected in hopes that when I am searching again, I can reach out to them directly.\n\nThe other most important thing that kept me sane was honestly having friends and a community around me. I also know co-workers that were also looking for a new job and we would be in constant contact to help and support each other during these things. Really it wasn't even for practice but just to vent and talk about the experiences and get it off our minds. Honestly the fact that I was able to talk about my rejections with someone and share such feeling alleviated myself from the pains of said rejections.\n\nFor the interviews themselves, I realized that there's no way to replicate the feeling of being in an interview, and especially an interview for a company you would want to get an offer from. You are going to feel stressed and nervous which would make you screw up easily. It is really hard to be stoic and emotionless when you know there's something on the line, and you cannot replicate such emotions. The best way for me to mitigate this was honestly having multiple companies I would want to work for. This way if I were to be rejected by A, I can still look forward to B.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, right now finding a new job is hard, and even harder to find somewhere you would want to work at. I am feeling both fortunate and grateful to finally finish my journey and to have such opportunities open for me, but it was also extremely stressful and anxiety inducing. It honestly feels like you have to be perfect in all the rounds to get a job in the current market. But hopefully this really long thread would help you in some ways, whether it's the details as to what I experienced during the loops, or the emotions I felt. Feel free to ask any questions though.",

    "raw": "Meta interview experience and preparation tips (London)Hey everyone, I've just secured a Meta IC4 role and wanted to share my experience and preparation process.  \nFor context, I have 9 YOE, mostly working at no-name companies doing full stack roles. I'm currently 2.5 years into my current role (startup) and haven't interviewed anywhere during that time. I also never did leetcode style interviews in the past.\n\nFrom receiving the initial call to final loop decision, it was a total of 8 weeks.\n\n# Screening\n\nFirst 2 weeks, did all the prep work material on the meta careers website.  \nTip: instead of watching the videos on the website look for the equivalent ones in hackerrank's youtube channel, they're also done by Gayle and have pretty much the same content, but much higher quality.\n\nAfter 2 weeks I had my mock interview.  \nDid ok, solved first problem and brute forced 2nd.  \nAt the end interviewer mentioned I was close to passing but **my code was not clean enough**.\n\nAfter this bought Leetcode premium and did 2 full weeks of just Meta top asked questions.  \nDid maybe 2-5 per day depending on how tired I was, as I didn't want to risk burning out.\n\nCome screening day, I got two variations of questions that I had seen before (mediums), solved them ok and proceeded to next round.\n\nTips:\n\n* -Make sure you write **clean** code, no unnecessary if's, no unnecessary variables, well named functions/variables, good identation to make it easier to read.\n* Always run a manual test case, this is your oportunity to catch bugs and fix them yourself before the interviewer intervenes.\n* Think out loud, this one is super important to keep your interviewer in the loop of what you're thinking. Sometimes your brain may be thinking one thing and you write another, this way they at least know what you were trying to do. (I do this often, saying \"A > B\", but write \"A < B\" or something like that). You can even just say read what you're typing out loud, that's fine and helps convey your thought process. I found it also helps me calm down my nerves, as the silence makes it worse.\n\n# Final loop\n\nI had 4 weeks to prepare for the final loop.\n\n**Product design**\n\nTo prepare for the Product Design interview I used: \n\n* [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/@hello\\_interview/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hello_interview/videos)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk\\_bGCTde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vK53SnrUjk&list=PLlvnxKilk3aKju0kDq9-UbAgNk_bGCTde)\n\nTried a few others too, but ultimately these gave me the most bang for buck.\n\nI watched one just to get a hang of the process and then for all subsequent ones, I first tried to resolve it myself on Excalidraw and then watched the video and updated my design where it made sense.\n\nI spent the majority of the first 2 weeks on this.\n\n**Behavioural**\n\nFor preparing for behavioural it was a mix of watching random youtube videos and using the AI tool from hello interview: [https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai](https://www.hellointerview.com/mock/ai)\n\nI didn't apply the STAR method, and instead tried to set up my examples as *stories* and tried to make it interesting for the interviewer to listen to.\n\nI didn't spend much time on this, maybe 2 days.  \nIn hindsight, this was not enough.\n\n**Coding**\n\nIn the final 2 weeks, I could feel myself getting a bit rusty in regards to coding and started panicking.  \nI then spent the majority of the final two weeks doing more LC top last 6 months Meta tagged questions.\n\nIn hindsight this was too much.\n\n**Final interviews**\n\nI booked both coding for the same day.  \nThe first interview went very well, connected well with interviewer and solved both problems optimally with time to spare.  \nI don't remember seeing either of them, but I reckon LC medium.\n\nThe 2nd interview wasn't as good, solved the first exercise optimally but only brute forced the second one.\n\nOn the 2nd day I had behavioural + product design.\n\nBehavioural went *ok*, interviewer was mostly reading questions from a script which felt a bit off as the interview didn't have much flow.\n\nProduct design also wasn't perfect. I did connect better with the interviewer and we bounced ideas off each other, but overall I felt that time went by VERY quickly.  \nTip: Make sure you practice resolving these on a timer. Aim to be able to complete an end to end design in 30ish minutes, including deep dives.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nHad a call with the recruiter 3 days later.  \nOverall they were happy with my performance, and I ended up in between IC4 and IC5 as I ranked IC4 for behavioural and IC5 for product design.  \nI was suprised at getting the IC5 signal, as I thought I needed a perfect design to do so, but that **is not the case**.\n\nIn the end I was placed at IC4, which is a down level from my current role but then again my current role is not at FAANG and I've never worked at FAANG either.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI found the process to be really good and well organised. The interviews are difficult, but they really want you to be able to present your best self and give you a lot of time and materials to prepare.\n\nOverall it was good that I managed to pass the interviews with a full time job and two toddlers, so there wasn't much time for preparing.   \nI did have to forfeit hobbies or other distractions during this time though.\n\nBut if I could do it, so can you!",

    "raw": "First ever internship interview experience - College JuniorFelt like sharing this because I honestly don't know how to reflect on this experience and or if I approached anything wrong.\n\nI was reached out to by a company I applied for a bit over a month ago for an interview for an SWE internship position. The only available time for the meeting was within 24 hours and I agreed. I spent the rest of the day and the following morning reviewing basic technical questions, general behavioral questions etc. I felt pretty confident going into the interview. One thing to note was that when I went to re-read what the position was that I was applying for, it was taken down and I couldn't access my application as it was locked, which was a bit concerning.\n\nIt was a 30 minute zoom interview which was scheduled with the manager of the department I was applying for and 3 other engineers on the team.\n\nBecause it was a 30 minute interview, I assumed it was just a screening--which it was, but since it was over zoom I still obviously dressed well and turned my camera on etc. I join the meeting a minute before the start time, and slowly waited for people to join. Took a few minutes, but before we started I realized I was just staring at myself and no one had their cameras on. Again, this is my *first* ever interview, so I don't know if this is normal? It felt extremely awkward from the get go.\n\nThey ask me some background about myself, why I'm interested in their company, which I genuinely was; it's an aerospace company, and I actually did my first year of college in aerospace, so it's something I'm relatively passionate about.\n\nAfter finishing that, it was just dead silent for about 30 seconds, and then \"Well, okay, can you explain one of these projects on your resume?\" Which I then proceeded to do, and explained the lifetime of the project, its goals and outcomes, challenges I faced and how I solved them etc.\n\nFor context, the project was a real-time album art displayer that was built with python and JavaScript which used an LED matrix and a Raspberry Pi, synchronized with Spotify through the Developer API. (There's more to the project, but that's really the only software integrated with hardware project I'd worked on so far, everything else is just purely software).\n\nI expressed a lot of interest in this project and was genuinely hoping for some reaction to it but again there was no visual cues as to what was going on, so I just sat there waiting for someone to ask something, which after a while was only asked if I'd worked on anymore projects with physical hardware implementation which I reluctantly responded with \"No, this was the first experience I'd had with it\" etc.\n\nI then explained another project I had done which was a website I built for my photography portfolio (side hobby / job of mine) using HTML, JS, MySQL, PHP and CSS. This was only responded to with, \"Well it's good that you also do your own projects too.\"\n\nAfter that, I was asked \"What's your favorite and least favorite part about Computer Science?\" This felt so... broad? I genuinely tried to give a good answer, saying I really enjoy building things with software that you can then interact with physically, but stumbled on what my \"least favorite part\" about CS was.\n\nThen I was asked, \"Do you know any legacy languages\" which I do not. So I responded with \"No, that's not something I've delved into myself, and along my college career we've only used more modern languages\".\n\nAwkward pause, then turned it to me to ask questions. I asked some things about what it's like interning for them, what kind of tasks you take on, how do you work as a team as an intern, and if there were any projects that they'd worked on that they found interesting (not sure if I should of asked the last one). Basically, the manager had to keep \"poking\" them by saying things like \"Do you guys want to chime in and answer?\" to which I got pretty bland responses like \"Yea we work as a team and there's always people you can talk to\".\n\nAfter that it wrapped up, I said thank you etc. and they said \"Alright, well that's about it. Bye.\" and left.\n\nI know this is an extremely lengthy post but I just cannot get it off my mind. It just felt so awkward, like they really did *not* care at all, and I really do feel like I had to have messed something up.

    "raw": "I got the chance to interview a Software Engineer at Carta (who graduated in 2017)I had the chance to interview Ather Qureshi, a software engineer at Carta. He’s got some interesting thoughts on how navigating the professional world is very different to learning in college and how problems in the real world can't really be solved like an exam at school.\n\n## Can you tell me a bit about what team you work on at Carta?\n\nCurrently, I work for the Finance Automation Team at Carta. As the name suggests, most of my team's work is aimed at building and maintaining software to automate financial operations but we also manage a bunch of internal tools at Carta. We work very closely with the core payments team at Carta, and we report directly to the finance team.\n\nSome key areas we work on:\n\n* Pure backend systems that integrate our system of record with third-party tools we use ie. salesforce\n* Internal facing UI that our customer support managers, account executives, and financial team uses to manage the relationship with our customers\n\nI like to think that we mainly build the glue that holds our financial software together and help automate manual operations. With this automation, we get cleaner data and allow us to take proactive actions.\n\nThe work is extremely rewarding and challenging as we directly interact with our stakeholders and we get full autonomy on how we solve their problems. As Carta continues to scale up, our work becomes paramount and we are positioned to produce a ton of impact.\n\n## How did you land your current job and why did you choose it?\n\nI heard about Carta through a friend who worked there. Carta was growing rapidly in 2019 / early 2020, and they were opening a Canadian office in Kitchener/Waterloo. It was a closer commute than my current job. I was already interviewing around, and I actually had an offer in hand before I reached out to Carta via a referral from that same friend. I decided to just go ahead with it since it’s always good to practice interview skills, and there is nothing to lose by potentially gaining another offer. I had not done a lot of research about Carta at this point.\n\nThe interview process was typical for SWE roles with some slight modifications. These were the steps I took in Jan of 2020:\n\n* Phone Screen with recruiter\n* Technical Screen with hiring manager\n* Virtual Pair Programming exercise with two engineers\n* 5 hour onsite interview, with two behavioural interviews, two technical (one coding and one system design), and a lunch interview.\n* Hiring Committee Manager Interview\n\nSome key things that I noticed during the interview was that the interviewers were extremely helpful and the questions being asked were not esoteric. The technical rounds consisted of practical problems that required you to work together towards solutions. The focus was more on turning ambiguity into specific requirements, iterating and making sure you covered all reqs - not testing if you knew specific algorithms. It was the first interview also where design patterns came into play.\n\nI loved that since how to organize your code is actually something that you face constantly in your job, and I feel it’s a better skill to assess versus if you can write iterative merge sort or whatever. The behaviour rounds assessed culture-fit and collaboration skills.\n\nI received positive feedback, and since I had another offer in hand, they expedited the interview process for me. All steps were completed within 3 business days. After a short while, Carta extended an offer. The offer was great and after doing more research at the company, I accepted. Some key things that pushed me towards accepting the offer was that:  \n\n\n* Carta acquired many talented ex-kik employees when they opened their canadian office. I felt these were a great group of people I would be near that I could learn from to become a better engineer\n* The compensation package and perks blew my other offer out of the window. Carta provided equity as part of my offer, and was already a unicorn (it had a 1.7B valuation in Summer 2019).\n* I read a lot of the Carta CEO’s blogs and spoke to Carta employees. I felt I resonated well with the culture (Transparent, kind, and flat).\n* The office was beautiful, and it was a much easier commute.\n\n## What does an average day look like? (I realize everyday is likely different, but this question helps identify a lot of the common functions that a Software Engineer is doing)\n\nFor me, I try my best to stick to a routine everyday and avoid overworking myself especially now that we have been working from home for almost a year. I usually get into around 3-4 hours of deep concentrated work per day, and then 3 hours of more light work where I am also in meetings.\n\nMy typical routine is:  \n\n\n* 9-9:30am: Eat a light breakfast, grab some tea, and catch up on any news and do a quick peek into my social circles\n* 10-Noon: my work laptop is open and I start my day responding to any immediate asks. I then work on my individual tasks. I’m the sharpest and most productive at this time of day. Usually there is less notifications at this time, since all my PST coworkers are sleeping. I can usually close out things that I was working on the previous day and do some code reviews.\n* Noon-1pm: If I can, I try to take the full hour for lunch, but I usually have meetings at this time. I’ll usually find something to nibble on during this time if I am busy. Most of my team works in PST, so this is their 9am.\n* 1pm-3pm: I usually have anywhere from an hour to two and a half hours of meetings. I have a quick sprint meeting, project sync meeting, and then we have regularly scheduled team meetings, company meetings, and engineering team meetings. I try my best to remain attentive and be engaged during the meeting, but often find myself doing light work in the background.\n* From when the meetings end till 5:30ish, I then try to grab a snack or lunch If I missed it, as well as take a break from the computer (usually take a walk). I then come back and stomp out some more deep work until the workday is finished. I try my best to set a clear plan for the next day (I use sticky notes) to help future me.\n* Post 5:30pm, I put my laptop lid down! I exercise, shower, and start preparing for dinner. I don’t look at work stuff anymore.\n\n## What is your favorite thing about working as a Software Engineer & what is your least favorite thing?\n\nMy favorite thing about being a software engineer is that we get to build amazing things directly. In today’s day and age, where technology is the main resource you need to utilize to bring value - a software engineer is the only profession that can take an idea to a tangible product. I like that I can deliver value quickly and not be dependent on things I don't understand or I’m not responsible for. My work is hands-on and I feel proud of what I can build.\n\nMy least favorite thing is probably that it is a lot of sitting in front of the computer. I have to make sure that I don’t over-work myself, get plenty of exercise, and socialize. The work is also pretty taxing, and sometimes I find myself pretty worn out mentally wise at the end of every work day. I have to make sure I take breaks, and remember that binging will lower my overall productivity.\n\n## How do you build confidence in dealing with new problems you have to solve at work?\n\nYou generally gain more confidence as you just solve more problems. I don’t think there’s another way to do it. But to add meat to this answer, I believe It depends on the type of problems. Depending on their scope or difficulty, I aim for solo or collaborative approaches. I also think it’s important to *believe* you can solve the problem even though you don’t have the details hashed out yet. I and also the rest of the engineers at Carta, value reasoning in plain english before we start touching code. Try your absolute best to have solved the problem on paper before you hit your editor.\n\nIn summary, I build confidence through good planning and collaboration with the team. Specific things too, I find TDD helps me alot when I’m tackling complicated behaviors. You write tests for what you want to implement, and then you can take an iterative approach to cover everything. Also, learning more about the tools I’m using helps a lot. Building a good mental model of it allows me to peek under the hood and find problems faster. A lot of the times you can use libraries which cover you from any complexity of the underlying tool, but I found understanding more than the API of said library, gave me insight why my behaviours weren’t working as expected. An example of this is if you learn how to query relational databases with SQL, it becomes a lot easier to understand what an ORM is doing or more importantly, why it’s not doing what you expect.\n\n## In [one of your articles](https://atherqureshi.medium.com/learning-and-doing-5825fcf2217a), you mention the differences between succeeding in an academic environments vs professional environment. What do you think students can do right now to better prepare themselves for the professional environment?\n\nMy best advice is to not lose your appetite for learning new things and constantly try to improve that skill. The skill of learning to learn. It’s imperative in a professional environment where you have to learn things fast, and deliver value all while making sure you aren’t pushing bugs or spaghetti. Take courses on challenging things you want to learn. Do your best to absorb the material and look deeper. You have nothing to lose from getting good marks, so I suggest trying to attain the highest marks you can get. This discipline will help you in the workplace.\n\n## What advice do you have for someone young (or old) looking to build a career in Software Engineering?\n\nI suggest that you take a course or build a small project and see if you enjoy it. If you don’t, choose a different career.\n\nThese are questions to ask yourself as well:\n\n* Do you like writing logic and optimizing it?\n* Do you like assembling the various pieces together and seeing it come together?\n* Do you like building UIs?  \n\n\nWhat I mean by that is to make sure you find something fun about SWE before diving into the field. You need to enjoy at least some part of it. Through pure randomness, you might have natural skills for this type of work but I argue that it’s not enough to take you through obstacles. I believe you need something intrinsic which will drive your relentlessness through these obstacles.\n\nSWE is difficult, detail-oriented, and puzzling work but if you enjoy the process and what you’re building, you can hold onto it until it gets slightly easier. If you are just clinging to SWE because you dream of the lifestyle of high compensation and flexibility, your motivation will likely get crushed at the first couple obstacles. You need a lot of patience!\n\n\\---------\n\n*That's it! Hope this was useful.

I get A's in all my CS courses and really apply myself but the way I fully came off as unexperienced and not knowledgeable is making me upset.\n\nI know this is just one interview and it won't kill me and it's a learning experience but I just needed to rant. I also am a junior and have this thing where I feel like I have to get an internship this summer but am too unqualified to apply.  I am also first generation in college and America so I have an insane pressure to be good at everything even though it is okay and valid to fail. \n\nIf there are any people who have been thru a similar experience and want to speak on it feel free.\n\nUpdate: all of you guys are very sweet & encouraging :( thank you for the advice & kind words. looking back irly was hating on myself but i feel better now. tech interviews suck but i think we will all get thru this. ty for all of the hugz i wish i could give them back",

I graduated in 2017 with a bachelors in computer engineering. I have no internships, while in school I helped run a family business. After graduating, I realized having no internships kind of ruined my chances of landing a job. 6 months in and I couldn't get job in the field. A family member of mine reached out and offered an opportunity to further expand the family business and took them up on that offer.\n\nFast forward 7 years, I am done with business. It's just not for me and I am extremely mad at myself for taking this long to realize. Over the last 3 months I have decided to go back to what I started and pursue the this field. I landed 2 interviews right away but I was clearly not ready and I have been brushing up on my skills since. Practicing and leetcoding.\n\nI know going into this decision I would be at a significant disadvantage especially with how the market is. Given such a lengthy gap in my resume, do I even have a chance in landing my first job? Part of me is saying to not give up and keep trying but I feel as if no matter how well I get with leetcoding and practicing interviews, I will never be given the opportunity since it has been 7 years of wasting away.\n\nI guess I want some insight into what you guys think given what I wrote here.

    "raw": "DFS Roadmap: A guide to mastering depth-first search for the coding interviewHey all!\n\nI'm Jimmy, a former Microsoft software engineer who is passionate about helping others prepare for the coding interview.\n\nDepth-first search is by far the most important topic you need to be familiar with for the coding interview. This is because it can be used across a variety of data structures and contexts.\n\nThis post is a roadmap for learning depth-first search for the coding interview. Following it will help you understand the fundamentals of the algorithm, and prepare you for all the different ways you might use DFS for your interviews.\n\n**What is Depth-First Search?**\n\nDepth-first search is an algorithm that is used to traverse every node in tree or graph-like data structures.\n\nIt begins at a node in the data structure and travels down as far as possible down a path before \"backtracking\" and moving to the next path.\n\n[visualizing depth-first search traversal on a binary tree. backtracking refers to the arrows that move \\\\\"up\\\\\", such as #3, #5, #6, #9, etc.](https://preview.redd.it/3ijibyjv6e2d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b16b3fa397f486416e417827d04f1f6b3892897)\n\nIt's helpful to think of DFS in terms of the current node and its neighbors. Here's a high-level pseudocode of DFS:\n\n`DFS(node):`  \n  `mark node as visited`  \n  `process node`  \n  `for each neighbor of node:`  \n`if neighbor is not visited:`  \n`DFS(neighbor)`\n\n# Step 1: Recursion and Binary Trees\n\nBinary trees are the simplest data structure on which you can apply depth-first search, which makes it a great starting point to learn the fundamentals. Each node has at most two neighbors, which are referred to as its left and right children. And since a tree cannot contain cycles, you don't have to worry about keeping track of visited nodes.\n\nDepth-first search is typically implemented as a recursive function, meaning it is a function that calls itself within its body. **When using depth-first search to solve binary tree problems, the most important thing is to figure out what each recursive function should return.**\n\n[This post](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees) teaches you how to properly visualize how a recursive depth-first search algorithm works to solve binary tree problems, and also presents a structured approach to using DFS to solve binary tree questions.\n\n[visualizing a recursive DFS solution](https://i.redd.it/2baii6e09e2d1.gif)\n\nYou can then practice applying that approach to these problems:\n\n|Question|Difficulty|\n|:-|:-|\n|[Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)|Easy|\n|[Path Sum](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/path-sum)|Easy|\n|[Calculate Tilt](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/calculate-tilt)|Easy|\n|[Diameter of a Binary Tree](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/diameter-of-a-binary-tree)|Easy|\n|[Path Sum II](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/path-sum-2)|Medium|\n|[Validate Binary Search Tree](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/binary-trees/validate-binary-search-tree)|Medium|\n\nAfter solving those problems, you should have a firm grasp of DFS fundamentals, which include:\n\n* being able to visualize the order in which nodes are \"visited\" during DFS (by extending as far as possible down until a leaf node).\n* what it means to \"backtrack\", which is what happens when we reach a leaf node in the tree, both visually and in terms of code that gets executed.\n\n# Step 2: Graphs\n\nFrom there, you can move onto applying DFS on graphs. Graphs are a more general data structure (binary trees are a special type of graph), but the fundamentals of DFS are the same.\n\nThe biggest difference between using DFS on graphs versus trees is that you need to keep track of the nodes that you visit somehow as you go. This is because graphs (unlike trees) contain cycles, and if you don't keep track of visited nodes as you go, you will get an infinite loop in which you are visiting the same nodes repeatedly.\n\nFor the coding interview, you need to make sure that you are very comfortable with how graphs are represented. The two most common ways are via the adjacency lists, and as 2D grids.\n\nAdjacency lists represent graphs by mapping each node to a list of its neighbors. In a 2D-grid, each cell in the grid is a node, and its neighbors are the cells that are connected to it in the north, east, west, and south directions.\n\n**You should be able to implement the base DFS algorithms on both adjacency lists and 2D grids effortlessly, ideally, from memory if possible.**\n\nGraph interview problems typically involve extending DFS in some way, and you want to ensure that you are devoting as much time as possible to the question at hand, and not fumbling with infinite loops or index errors.\n\n[This post](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/graphs) teaches you basic graph terminology, how to visualize the different graph representations, as well as how the basic DFS algorithm works on both adjacency lists and 2D grids.\n\n[DFS on an adjacency list](https://i.redd.it/l9b999dl9e2d1.gif)\n\n[DFS on a 2D grid](https://i.redd.it/77v6bysm9e2d1.gif)\n\nThere are a few \"categories\" of DFS graph problems that you should be familiar with:\n\n**Basic Traversal**\n\nThese questions involve using DFS to visit each node in the graph and performing some action at each node.\n\n|Question|Difficulty|\n|:-|:-|\n|[Copy Graph](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/graphs/copy-graph)|Easy|\n|[Flood Fill](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/graphs/flood-fill)|Easy|\n\n**Connected Components**\n\nThese questions involve using DFS to find the number of connected components in a graph. To find a connected component, you start a node in the graph, and then use DFS to visit all its neighbors. When that call to DFS returns, you move onto the next unvisited node in the graph, which is the start of a new connected component.\n\n|Question|Difficulty|\n|:-|:-|\n|[Number of Islands](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/graphs/number-of-islands)|Medium|\n|[Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/description/)|Medium|\n\n**\"Boundary\" DFS**\n\nThese questions involve initiating DFS from the \"boundaries\" of the graph to find all nodes reachable from the boundary.\n\n|Question|Difficulty|\n|:-|:-|\n|[Surrounded Regions](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/graphs/surrounded-regions)|Medium|\n|[Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow)|Medium|\n\n# Step 3: Backtracking\n\nThe last type of problem that involves using DFS are \"backtracking\" problems. These problems don't involve traversing over an explicit data structure such as a tree or a graph.\n\nInstead, you have to use variables to define what each \"node\" is, and also define the \"neighbors\" of each node in terms of those variables. Once you have that formulation, you have everything you need to apply DFS.\n\nThese problems can be tricky at first, but once you can see them as depth-first search problems, they become a lot more manageable. Here are some examples to help you visualize how they work:\n\n[Combination Sum](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/backtracking/combination-sum)\n\n[Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/backtracking/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number)\n\n[In this backtracking algorithm, each \\\\\"node\\\\\" is the current combination of digits, and the neighbors are all the combinations that can be formed by extending that current combination by one digit.](https://i.redd.it/cfpzks24ae2d1.gif)\n\nWorking through these three types of problems will allow you to use DFS in the variety of contexts that are required by the coding interview.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n* Jimmy",

Figured I could get some insights here!\n\nPretend you want to keep track of a leaderboard in a marathon.

When I watch a video, everything works, and I feel like I am the only person who makes all the mistakes. Watching a person live coding is an entirely different experience.

You also have the opportunity to ask questions while the person is doing something.\n\nYou can also comment on videos or video courses, but the time it takes to get an answer is usually much longer compared to a question asked in the live coding chat while the other person is working on the project.

    "raw": "How to prepare for Meta product architecture interviewYo,\n\nI'm an former Meta Staff engineer and interviewer and now I spend my days helping candidates prepare for upcoming FAANG interviews. The question I get asked most often is: how is the meta product architecture interview different from system design and how can i prepare for it?\n\nFigured I'd spend a moment documenting my answer for folks:\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe Product Architecture interview is the System Design equivalent for Product Software Engineers (SWE, Product). It is a 45-minute interview where you will be asked to design a user-facing product by defining the requirements, architecting the APIs, and drawing a high-level system diagram. \"User-facing\" is the key term here. This means it's questions like \"Design Facebook's news feed\" or \"Design Ticketmaster\" and not \"Design a distributed cache\" or \"Design a load balancer\". You should be able to design the entire system with mostly AWS (or equivalent) components.\n\n  \n**How to best prepare?** \n\nJust like with coding questions, you can classify product architecture (and really system design) questions into categories based on shared patterns. For user facing product, there are 10 main categories that show up in the interview: \n\n1. **Streaming Services:** Design challenges related to real-time data streaming and content delivery (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).\n2. **Online Ticketing Systems**: Addressing consistency and concurrency in high-demand ticket sales (e.g., Ticketmaster, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Airbnb).\n3. **Location-Based Services:** Designing for location tracking and geo-based recommendations (e.g., Yelp, Uber).\n4. **E-commerce Platforms:** Scalability and transaction management for online shopping (e.g., Amazon, eBay).\n5. **Social Media Networks:** Handling data scalability, real-time updates, and network effects (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).\n6. **Online Banking and Financial Services:** Ensuring security, privacy, and transaction consistency (e.g., PayPal, online banking portals).\n7. **Collaborative Editing Tools:** Concurrency and conflict resolution in real-time document editing (e.g., Google Docs, note-taking apps).\n8.  **Messaging Platforms:** Real-time messaging, notifications, and chat systems (e.g., Messenger, Slack)\n9. **Cloud Storage Services:** Efficient and scalable file storage and sharing solutions (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive).\n10. **Online Competition Platforms:** Real-time interaction, leaderboard management, and competition handling (e.g. LeetCode, online chess).\n\n  \nQuestion from each of these categories share patterns, technologies, and techniques to answering them. If I were studying for the interview, my game plan would be:\n\n1. **Pick a category**: Start with the category that you feel least comfortable with.\n2. **Solve a problem**: Find a problem from that category and solve it. Ideally, you'd choose a problem from [this list](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/ticketmaster) since there are answer keys included. This means going over to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (which is what is used in the Meta interview), starting a 35-minute timer, following the Delivery Framework recommended above, and solving the problem.\n3. **Self-Assessment**: After the 35 minutes are up, you should know exactly where you got tripped up. For each of the areas where you felt less comfortable, open up ChatGPT or Google and fill your knowledge gaps.\n4. **Review the Answer Keys**: Once you've finished the unguided learning, head back over to our [Common Problem Breakdowns](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/ticketmaster) and review the solution. The solution should click given you just struggled through the problem yourself. If you chose a question that we have not written a solution for just yet, then use YouTube or Google to find a solution online and compare it to your own.\n\n\n\n**Top Product Architecture Questions**\n\n1. [Design Ticketmaster](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/ticketmaster)\n2. [Design Uber](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/uber)\n3.

    "raw": "Common Mistakes to Avoid in a System Design InterviewOver the past month I've been doing mock interviews for folks in this group ([Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1385a69/need_help_with_system_design_interviews_ive/)) and a couple common mistakes have shown up time and time again that are worth calling attention to.\n\n# Spending way too much time \"Understanding the problem\"\n\nA system design interview is short. At Meta, they are 45 minutes with 5 minutes on either side for intros and questions. This means you have 35 minutes to impress the interviewer. As many of you know, you should always start by clarifying the functional and non-functional requirements, asking some clarifying questions, and doing back-of-the-envelope calculations. That said, almost everyone from this group that I mocked with spent too much time here and, if not for me hurrying us along, would have spent even more time. This isn't the important part of the interview. The more time you spend here, the less time you have for what matters. The more senior you are, the more true this is.\n\n**Lesson:** Don't spend more than 5 minutes \"understanding the problem.\" Be concise, move quick, and leave room for what really matters.\n\n# Answers Lack Depth\n\nIt's a dead giveaway when a candidate has read Alex Xu's book but never designed a system. They will throw buzzwords around nervously and try to move on before getting \"caught.\" We (the interviewer) notice every time, and 9 times out of 10 we note this and circle back to confirm our suspicion by asking probing questions on the subject. At which point, you're drowning. If you don't know a concept well, then either don't mention it or be honest that you lack depth in a subject -- no need to walk yourself into a landmine.\n\n**Lesson:**\n\n1. As you're prepping, if there are concepts you know you lack depth on, revisit them and go deep. Watch videos, read blogs, etc. But don't move on until you truly grasp the concept.\n2. If you need to enter a interview weak on some topics (it happens), then avoid mentioning them. You can't prevent the interviewer from asking, but you can prevent yourself from teeing them up. For example, it's better to not mention CAP Theorem than to stumble over an inaccurate definition.\n\n# Not Leaving Space for the Interviewer to Guide You\n\nThe system design interview is unique in that the candidate guides the conversation. This is great, but it can also go terribly wrong. Many candidate take this to mean that they should just keep talking to fill space. Don't do this. Once you've finished a train of thought, pause, and ask the interviewer for confirmation. ie. \"Does this make sense?\", \"Is it ok if I move onto X?\", etc. They have a list of checkboxes they are trying to check. Help them help you and give them the space to guide you toward what you're missing. Many interviewers are inexperienced and will not interrupt you. This leads to a candidate talking for 35 minutes about who knows what and the interviewer getting no signal because they were too nervous to interject.\n\n**Lesson:** Help your interviewer help you by giving them space to guide you via periodic confirmations, check ins, and questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout me:- I am a former Meta tech lead who conducted 100s of interviews while at Meta for 5 years.",

But, like the Medium article, it also seems to imply steering clear of any discussion of architecture.\n\nI’m just getting mixed messages and would like some clarity on what I should be focusing on.\n\nSo here’s a list of questions (and I’m sure I’ll have more later):\n\n* How deep/shallow should I be with architecture? Should I just touch on it briefly, or is it worth discussing some tradeoffs there?\n* Should the frontend be discussed at all?\n* I can’t seem to find any mock interviews for this, so I’ve been watching/listening system design interviews on my commute, and trying to think how I would alter it for product design. Ideally, I would like to hear/see at least **one** good example of a successful product design interview. Any leads on where I might find mock Product design interviews?\n* When discussing the API, is it worth mentioning error codes, versioning, async tasks, and other niche topics?\n* Should I discuss gathering user metrics to inform decisions?\n* In a similar vein should I be focusing on the “soft design” (i.e. product requirements, customer impact, and future roadmap), or stick more to the \"hard design” (i.e. API and data models)?\n\nThanks in advance! My interview is Jan9 & 10\n\nP.S. Yes, I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/17xjdgb/what_the_hell_is_the_difference_between_metas/) post, but I'm still unclear about the above questions\n\nUPDATE: So I took the interview, I passed, but at IC4 level. They weren't allowed to give any feedback, which sucks because I'd love to know where I fell short\n\nThe question centered around one feature, and since I used websockets I actually didn't have much of an API. So all that info about being API-centric (i.e. [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process/meta-facebook),  [hellointerview](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/meta-system-vs-product-design?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=product-vs-system), and [this](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1173258/product-design-vs-systems-design-interview-at-fb-looking-for-study-prep-suggestions) leetcode comment from below) wasn't so applicable in my case.\n\nIt was pretty much a system design interview.

Mostly on the protocol level, quite far from any business logic.\n\nI'm applying for a position at a well-known public company and the job description seems to match my skillset. However, I was just invited to a 90 minute system design interviews with 3 engineers. That seems to be longer than usual from what I gathered? I'm also allowed to look up information online during the interview and I'm kinda puzzled about what they will want me to design. I've started reading Alex Xu's book and <Grokking the system design interview>. But the examples there are so different from my experience that I think it will be obvious I'm just memorizing things. I also don't think I will have enough practical knowledge to talk for close to 90 minutes.\n\nAny suggestions? Also, how screwed am I if I fail the system design interview magnificently?\n\n",

    "raw": "Interview Prep & Company Experiences - Detailed post**LONG POST ALERT. But worth it I promise.**\n\nI commented on a couple of posts and was asked a lot of questions about my interview prep and other details so decided on creating a post. Also I will keep adding details to this post as I remember details or get asked questions.  Please be kind. It took me forever to write this.\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This is how I prepared. Might not be the best approach for you but you can take this as another data point and see if you can improve on it or add it to your method of preparation.\n\n**About me**: 5 YOE, started preparing Jan 2022. Worked at Kindle, Alexa and AWS for all of that time and joining Google(L5 - Senior) in 2 weeks. Interviewed for a total of 11 companies and got an offer(or moved to offer stage) from 8 of those.\n\n# Preparation\n\n**Intro Call -** This is the first call with HR or the recruiter for the company. Most of the people don't prepare for this. And honestly you don't need to as long as you are clear in what you want from the interview process. Keep a short description of your work/role ready. Second, make sure you know what role you want to apply for and why are you looking for a change. If it is Senior you are targeting then mention that. Even if Recruiter says levelling is determined by interview performance you should mention that you are looking for Senior. Do not provide answers like I am looking for senior but will be okay with downlevel. Some recruiters might also ask your area of expertise (Frontend, backend, cloud etc). I had 5 bullet points which conveyed all of the information above. Everybody knows how to identify red flags but sometimes in the flow of things you might provide one which you will think about later. So keep information written and avoid speaking from outside of it.\n\n**Coding -** Alright so this is the obvious one. A lot of it is repetitive but I liked it since it made my speed of solving questions and understanding patterns better. I started with understanding concepts using Algoexpert since I was overwhelmed by the number of different type of problems when I opened leetcode. I was not bad but every time I solved a new type of problem I always had a question of have I solved all types now? So I went through major concepts in AlgoExpert all the while also solving leetcode equivalents (Easy + Mediums and only doing a couple hards every once in a few days in the beginning). Once I went through \\~75% of Algoexpert then I stopped using it in favor of leetcode. You can also use Neetcode or other methods instead of Algoexpert for concepts. No replacement of leetcode found for me lol. Some ways with which I improved problem over problem:\n\n1. Even though I solved a problem with ease, look at the provided solution and discussion board to understand better / other ways of solving something. This helps in sharpening your brain and maybe one approach would be faster and other would be less prone to errors etc.\n2. No IDE. I coded directly on leetcode without autocomplete. There is something comforting about being able to solve questions without any help and it paid off when all these companies had their own tool to test you.\n3. Time. I used leetcode timer to track how I was doing. 15 mins easy, 20 mins medium and 30 hard. I used to exceed the limits in the beginning but as time passed I was able to do more problems in the stipulated time. Start the timer when you start reading the question.\n4. Decide on approach and think about it fully before starting to code. Helps build critical thinking and fail fast habit. If you are able to think of failure scenarios before you are coding then you my friend are elite. I struggled in this one.\n5. Speak. This will sound weird but yeah, talk aloud when solving new questions since you will have to do it in an interview. I had multiple friends not crack interviews because they felt like telling each and every step of what you are doing is pointless. It might be in application development but not when you are proving to another person that you have what it takes.\n6. Structure your code and have proper variable names. There are rounds in certain companies which take this into account. Specially FAANG.\n7. And lastly, be humble. If you are able to solve more questions today than yesterday, keep that momentum going and do not let it get to your head. I struggled with this one in the beginning too lol.\n\nI solved company questions days before I interviewed for them and not before. Except Meta. Only solve company questions for that. Reasons listed below under company.\n\n**System Design -** You might or might not have this round based on the level you are interviewing for and the company. For this one if you have designed systems for your current employer then you are already half done. I had designed systems before but I wanted to know what is the structure of the interview and how to tackle questions all within an hour. Also obviously the different types of ambiguous questions you can get. I went through Alex Xu's System design interview book. (I used to read it when I got bored of coding or for breaks between coding days). It is the perfect starter. Moved on to Systems Expert and Grokking the system design. Each tool has something unique to provide.\n\n1. Alex Xu - simplified beginner stuff. Amazing if you want to dive in and read from scratch. Also the best chapter is the first one. Scaling.\n2. Systems Expert - Great for explanations and how do you move from topic to topic in interview. Understanding -> Requirements -> Data -> HLD -> Tradeoffs -> Questions -> Rewind\n3. Grokking - The types of problems and width of knowledge.\n4. Just taking up any random software you see and try to build it and then search. This is a true test. I picked up unconventional designs for practice like Query execution platform for a cloud DB, Robinhood, credit Karma or even IOS software update rollout.\n\nIf you are interviewing for something above L5 or an experienced L5 then you will need more material for depth as well. PS: Invest in a whiteboard if you can. Helps when you can draw things in 3 seconds when compared to 10.\n\n**Behavioural -** Not much here but keep examples of what you have done in the past ready. Some  Some common topics are:\n\n1. Your experience or projects you have worked in.\n2. Lead a project. How did you manage timelines, work with multiple people, how did the delivery of project go etc.\n3. Conflict Resolution. How did you solve arguments between you and others or between 2 people of your team.\n4. Best Practices. Your views about them and how to bring best practices in the team.\n\n**Offer Negotiation -** Congratulations you have moved to this stage. Make sure to have some numbers handy but don't provide the recruiter the numbers. Do your research about how much does a company pay for location, level and YOE. Check [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) for this. Get competing offers. Do not lie about offers since some companies ask for proof like Google. Try to schedule interviews such that you are getting offers around the same time. This can be discussed in intro call when the Recruiter tells you the process and how long it generally takes. You can ask for more time if required. All the best!\n\n# Interview Experiences\n\n**Google (Accepted offer L5) -** One of the best experiences I had. Every Interviewer was accommodating and all but one were a pleasure to talk to. Coding (3 rounds) was Mediums and Hard. I did good on 2 and did okay on one. They used some variation of google docs which I hated for interviews but here coding directly in leetcode helped. Solving company tagged questions based on frequency was a hit or miss. System Design was amazing. They asked me a question I had not solved before but luckily I was able to use some experience from the past and my prep to build solutions and talk about trade offs. The System Design interviewer was very accommodating and let me use a white board I had and kept taking notes so I don't have to draw on google docs. Focus is more on approach and how you tackle patterns rather than the final solution. Pro Tip: If you have experience and show that in Intro call you can ask to skip phone screen. I did the same. Getting full loop scheduled is always the best.\n\n**Meta (Offer high E5) -** Very different from Google. Focus is on **speed** and accuracy and not on approach. Solving company tagged questions was a 100% hit on phone screen plus actual coding rounds. This is also based on my friend's experiences as well. Speed is in bold because you are expected to solve 2 mediums in 35-40 mins. I hated the system design round. I read about this before that Meta system design interviewers are like a wall but my god. No expressions or words and me talking for 20 mins straight at a time. Not fun but helped me in subsequent interviews. I was told my performance here is what got me down levelled since I killed it in the coding rounds. Pro tip: when asked in interview to introduce yourself, do it in under 30 seconds. Do not take your own time away from coding / system design unless details are asked.\n\n**Microsoft (Offer 63) -** Very team specific interviews for some reason. I was asked a lot of coding questions that were related to OS. Scheduling etc (Leetcode Mediums). System design was very non generic. Again asked very OS style design. I was able to answer but was not confident until I got the offer call. Overall my experience was not great since I had to follow up with recruiter multiple times and they were not willing to give me more than a couple days in deciding on offer. I wonder if they were worried that I will not accept Microsoft if I get other offers. It is a great company, not sure why would they do that. Also heavy focus on YOE? I had to fight for the 63 round of interviews since recruiter said 62 is more suited for my YOE.\n\n**LinkedIn (Offer Staff) -** Great questions and people again. A healthy mix of company tagged questions (Leetcode mediums and one Hard total) and some new ones of well known concepts. System Design was great as it felt more like a discussion. Question was a bit unconventional so not sure if I performed great or okay. I had to give 2 days of interviews since I was first interviewed for a Senior and then Staff based on performance. The second was was a steep increase in difficulty and depth of knowledge test specially in System Design. Pro Tip: I missed mentioning which level I want to interview for here and since interviews differ by level in LinkedIn, mention it during recruiter call.\n\n**Uber (Offer L5A) -** By far the hardest interview in terms of coding. I was asked a total of 4 questions(2 mediums and 2 hards) in 2 interviews total. I had seen 1 medium before and knew how to solve the other medium and hard. The second hard was tricky and related to path finding. I got to know the optimal way of solving very late and then was not able to solve the full thing but conveyed my approach. System Design went okay. I did not have a good time with the interviewer here since to me it felt like after every 10 mins he would mention how great Uber is and the complexity of problems they solve there. I understand that a team/company might be doing something great but it should affect how you conduct interviews negatively. I would have deciding to go to Uber if I did not have a bad experience in that interview since I found out that the interviewer was going to be my colleague in the team.\n\n**Stripe (Offer L3) -** Best interview experience so far. Very different. No leetcode style questions. Simple questions which check how do you do development tasks and regular day to day dev work. I wish other orgs take this approach. Coding was very simple. Bug bash was good if you follow a structured approach and know how to use debugger of your favourite IDE. Integration was straight forward as well. What I really loved was the System Design. It felt natural and like I am actually designing a system at my current work. Kudos to Stripe for making the interview process so good.\n\n**Twitter (Offer Senior) -** Not much tips to give here. It was a simple interview process and the coding questions were 90% from the leetcode tagged questions list with a minor twist here and there. System Design was simple as well and was asked a very well known question. The only thing that was checked in my view was how deep I could go in data storage and access patterns.\n\n**Doordash (Offer E5) -** Almost all questions were from company tagged leetcode. Focus was on accuracy and edge cases. Good interview experience in terms of coding. System Design was very doordash products specific but can be solved if you have done all questions of grokking series. Nothing out of the ordinary here. If I had to rate the difficulty with Uber being 9/10, this would be a 4/10 along with Microsoft.\n\n**Databricks (Painful Rejection) -** Loooong process which takes forever to complete. Recruiter call -> Phone Screen -> Manager call -> Interviews -> Take home assignment -> Reference checks. I had fun till the Take home assignment since the interview questions were challenging but made sense and not your regular trick leetcode hards. Take home assignment was a lot of fun too since I actually learned new tricks while solving it during the course of 2 days. But why reference checks which need to include an ex manager? They pestered all the contacts I provided and grilled them with unnecessary questions. I was rejected based on reference checks? Pro tip: Do not interview here unless you actually wanna go here no matter what.\n\n**Upcoming Startup (Rejected, cannot name for some reasons) -** I was just done with interviewing by this point and tired. Also I had less motivation since I already had some offers. Shame because that means I wasted time of the interviewers. During one of the coding questions I blanked and was not even able to give a brute force approach. Bad day for me. Lesson: never interview more than required. There is definitely such a thing as mental tiredness.\n\n**ByteDance (Ghosted) -** The interview was split in 2 rounds. 2 coding and then after clearing that 1 more coding and system design etc. I cleared the 2 coding where questions were completely new but like Medium/Medium-Hard. Recruiter scheduled the next round of interviews the week after and sent a mail day before cancelling the interviews and said would reschedule. Never heard back even after sending multiple mails? Weird.\n\nYou can ask me questions below and I will try to answer or add it to the post here.",

    "raw": "Goolge Software Eng Interview Experience(L4 to L3 downlevel)\nHey everyone.\n\nI was reached out by a Recruiter in early December for an L4 role. All interviews (1 phone screen and 3 coding and 1 behavioural) happened. The feedback was:\n\nPhone screen: hire for L4, strong hire for L3. He said if code was modular, it would have been SH.\n\nRound 1: Hire\n\nRound 2:, No Hire\n\nRound 3: Kinda mixed. Lean hire for L4 but debugging, coding etc were very good. He asked a warm up & the main problem. But in feedback, he said he had one more problem to ask and hence gave lean L4.\n\nBehavioural: recruiter said it's positive and interviewer gave good feedback.\n\nExtra Coding round: I asked recruiter to have one more round to compensate No Hire round. She said it's positive(didn't mention it was hire/lean hire).\n\nDue to No Hire round, had a few team matching before going to hiring committee. 2 HMs showed interest(after team match call), out of which 1 position got closed. The other HM approved and the packet went to hiring committee.\n\nThe hiring committee gave Hire for L3 but No hire for L4.\n\nThe no hire interviewer fuc\\*\\*d me.\n\n**Background**: He asked a simple range max problem on array. To which I gave segment tree solution. Now during explanation he asked me to prove why **search** is logN, which I explained intuitively(like we divide the array in half each time and store answer, max height of tree will be logN). He said if during search query(l, r) you are going *max(query(l, mid), query(mid+1, r))*, here you are going both side of tree so how come it will be logN. I said it will go left/right some constant number of times and eventually some range will satisfy and it won't go further.\n\nbut then he said \"I understand what you are saying, but your answer is not conclusive and you need to prove mathematically\". Which I tried and couldn't do.\n\nThen during implementation it took me 4-5 minutes to write build function (last time I implemented it was in 2019 :( ) and missed the base condition, he pointed it out and I fixed it. Solution was completed. He said looks good.\n\nBut in feedback this guy wrote very bad feedback like:\n\n1. Gave solution but couldn't explain complexity. Fine\n2. He exaggerated the base condition miss in feedback : \"implemented a solution which would run infinitely and candidate fixed it only after explicitly pointing out...\". Even though during interview he simply asked me, when will this function stop and I quickly realised, explained and fixed it.\n\nI know it's my fault as well for 2nd round that I was slow but I really hate the feedback given by the interviewer. It's very tough to prove some things like greedy solutions, algo's like randomized quick sort will be NlogN etc. Idk why he judged purely based on one simple thing. It just frustrates me, I feel no amount of preparation could have saved me from that \"prove mathematically\" question he asked.\n\n\n\nDue to which the HC feedback says that the \"candidate took more time during implementation and hence not going with L4, but L3. They did not consider the extra round saying 'coming up with solution was slow for 2nd round and additional round cann't compensate that'\" like what bro. It depends on problem as well. How can you judge the problem solving based on 1 thing.\n\nI have around \\~2.5 years of experience at a mid size product startup as SDE2.\n\nMy Current base is above 25, no stocks. is it worth joining as L3?

Where:  Weight(A) + Weight(B) <= Weight(C)  \n>  \n>  \nReturn the most efficient combination of boxes in a List<List<Integer>> representing each trip that results in the fewest number of trips required to fully unload the truck.\n\n    List<List<Integer>> minimumTrips(int[] weights) {}\n\n>Example:  \n>  \n>**weights: \\[1,3,5,6,7,8,9,13,15\\]**  \n>  \n>Invalid Combinations/Trips:  \n>  \n>\\[1,13,15\\], \\[3,5,9\\], \\[6,7\\], \\[8\\]  \n>  \n>Valid Combinations/Trips:  \n>  \n>\\[1,9,15\\], \\[3,5,8\\], \\[6,7,13\\]\n\n\\*edit\\*- clarified acceptance criteria",

Spent 3 months after graduating in December 2023 grinding every day working on side projects, upskilling, networking, all to end up not having any luck with the current market and instead returning to where I did my internship. I guess I had a good reputation with them so I was gladly welcomed back without any proper interview. My title is Software Dev in the eng department and I am starting 70K with benefits, bonuses and I am already pretty familiar with the company. I have a few weeks off before my start date so I will definitely be taking some time off to relax before I start prepping for the full time lifestyle! Good luck to everybody. Your chance will come eventually.

    "raw": "Should you handle edge cases inside the for loop for simplicity in interview?Hey guys. What do you usually do when taking care of edge cases for problems like: [605. Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75).\n\nI tried to handle the edge cases outside the for loop for runtime optimization, but ended up missing a lot of them. There are a lot of edge cases and is really hard to take them all into consideration. \n\nSo here's the dillema: on one one hand, handling the edge cases outside the for loop seems to be a good practice since it optimize the runtime of the code.
