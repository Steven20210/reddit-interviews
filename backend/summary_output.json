    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",

In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?\n\n",

    "raw": "Google Intern SDE - Interview Experience ( on campus )\n\nThe interview process first consisted of an online assessment, shortlisting around 20 students, mostly based on the assessment performance\n\nNext, there were 2 interview rounds, purely based on leetcode problems and DSA. They don't even look at your resume, as long as you perform well in both the rounds.\n\nNOTE - you are given a Google doc pad for coding, no compiler, just like normal docs\n\nROUND 1 -\n\nGiven an class 'event', consisting of id, type, score, time etc. and a stream of events that you get as an input, count the number of superstreaks, which is basically the number of times we get a continuous stream of events of same type, and some constraints of the score and time.\n\nConceptually very simple,  but took some time to implement.\n\nFollowed by 3-4 follow up problems, like if we add a user id to the class, and for each user count the streaks and so on.\nAlso find number of streaks for a user in a given time range. We use prefix sum for this.\n\nThe interviewer was very helpful and kept complimenting my coding methods and approaches.\n\nThe interviewer went for 45 minutes.\n\nTIPS - use camel case, write comments, and even if you don't write the exact correct code, make sure that the interviewer understands and verifies your approach.\n\nROUND 2 -\n\nGiven a vector of strings, where each string is name of player, and any two players with a common letter between them are part of the same team. Find the number of teams\n\nWent with DSU approach, to find number of connect components, treating each player as a node, and connecting whenever we have a common letter between two players.\n\nFirst I went with an unoptimal approach, using DSU for all N players as nodes , which results in TC - N*L*alpha(N) , where L is avg length of string.\n\nThe interviewer pointed towards a N*L*alpha(26) approach, where we combine DSU using the alphabets and I was able to solve it from there.\n\nThe interview was over within 30 minutes.\n\nTIPS - study graphs really well, you don't need to go deep and do stuff like dp on graphs etc. Also, focus on monotonic stacks, prefix sums, and trees. just strengthen your basics, neetcode 250 should be more than enough for google DSA rounds.\n\nRESULT - Accepted\n\nIf you have any doubts AMA !",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?\n\n  \nP.S. Sorry for the long post.",

Also questions for similar position threads in India are quite different from what I've seen on codesignal website sample questions. \n\nCouldn't find much interview experience details for their US position here so creating this thread.

    "raw": "Google Intern SDE - Interview Experience ( on campus )\n\nThe interview process first consisted of an online assessment, shortlisting around 20 students, mostly based on the assessment performance\n\nNext, there were 2 interview rounds, purely based on leetcode problems and DSA. They don't even look at your resume, as long as you perform well in both the rounds.\n\nNOTE - you are given a Google doc pad for coding, no compiler, just like normal docs\n\nROUND 1 -\n\nGiven an class 'event', consisting of id, type, score, time etc. and a stream of events that you get as an input, count the number of superstreaks, which is basically the number of times we get a continuous stream of events of same type, and some constraints of the score and time.\n\nConceptually very simple,  but took some time to implement.\n\nFollowed by 3-4 follow up problems, like if we add a user id to the class, and for each user count the streaks and so on.\nAlso find number of streaks for a user in a given time range. We use prefix sum for this.\n\nThe interviewer was very helpful and kept complimenting my coding methods and approaches.\n\nThe interviewer went for 45 minutes.\n\nTIPS - use camel case, write comments, and even if you don't write the exact correct code, make sure that the interviewer understands and verifies your approach.\n\nROUND 2 -\n\nGiven a vector of strings, where each string is name of player, and any two players with a common letter between them are part of the same team. Find the number of teams\n\nWent with DSU approach, to find number of connect components, treating each player as a node, and connecting whenever we have a common letter between two players.\n\nFirst I went with an unoptimal approach, using DSU for all N players as nodes , which results in TC - N*L*alpha(N) , where L is avg length of string.\n\nThe interviewer pointed towards a N*L*alpha(26) approach, where we combine DSU using the alphabets and I was able to solve it from there.\n\nThe interview was over within 30 minutes.\n\nTIPS - study graphs really well, you don't need to go deep and do stuff like dp on graphs etc. Also, focus on monotonic stacks, prefix sums, and trees. just strengthen your basics, neetcode 250 should be more than enough for google DSA rounds.\n\nRESULT - Accepted\n\nIf you have any doubts AMA !",

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?\n\n  \nP.S. Sorry for the long post.",

You can always go back and practice more of something later.

    "raw": "How do you get through the inital months of not feeling ready for OAs?\n\nApologizes if this is a dumb question, but I was wondering how yall got yourselves out of the negative feedback loop of not feeling ready to take on actual technical interviews because you haven't practice enough yet in the beginning of your LC journey. I started my leetcode journey at the beginning of summer, I felt like I would easily get burnt out if I was spending hours studying, so I just consistently do about 20-30 minutes a day, just do one problem a day. I have been following [algomap.io](http://algomap.io) cus I like the way they visualize the answer before coding, I totally feel like a beginner still, I’ve managed to get a couple easy questions done by myself, but majority of the medium questions I could not get the answer at all after 20 minutes. In terms of schooling, I am in my last semester, so I still have time to develop my skills before rushing to get a job. But the reason I asked this question is because I recently got the invitation to do the first round OA for Capitol One. If I am being honest, I know I’m not going to do well based off how I’m doing in LC. I am still going to take it for the experience, but I’m in this constant negative loop where I don’t feel ready to take these OAs, but I need to apply to jobs, I do need a job, I don’t want to wait till I graduate to start applying. That’s why I wanted to ask how do yall get through the initial months of not feeling ready at all? I’ve been trying to slowly increase the amount of studying I need to do, I’ve been slowly started liking LC, but I have a lot of moments where if I am totally lost, I just lose all motivation to even try. So, any advice would be greatly appreciative. Thank you.\n\n",

I started my leetcode journey at the beginning of summer, I felt like I would easily get burnt out if I was spending hours studying, so I just consistently do about 20-30 minutes a day, just do one problem a day. I have been following [algomap.io](http://algomap.io) cus I like the way they visualize the answer before coding, I totally feel like a beginner still, I’ve managed to get a couple easy questions done by myself, but majority of the medium questions I could not get the answer at all after 20 minutes. In terms of schooling, I am in my last semester, so I still have time to develop my skills before rushing to get a job. But the reason I asked this question is because I recently got the invitation to do the first round OA for Capitol One. If I am being honest, I know I’m not going to do well based off how I’m doing in LC. I am still going to take it for the experience, but I’m in this constant negative loop where I don’t feel ready to take these OAs, but I need to apply to jobs, I do need a job, I don’t want to wait till I graduate to start applying. That’s why I wanted to ask how do yall get through the initial months of not feeling ready at all? I’ve been trying to slowly increase the amount of studying I need to do, I’ve been slowly started liking LC, but I have a lot of moments where if I am totally lost, I just lose all motivation to even try. So, any advice would be greatly appreciative. Thank you.\n\n",

    "raw": "Bombed a consulting firm case interview, DONE with this circus!\n\n**TL;DR:** After playing catch-up with a million AI topics/trends, hit my breaking point when they wanted a case interview, didn't prep, bombed it, and now I'm a hollow husk. The hiring bar is a joke.\n\nAs a new grad in AI/Data Science with experience, I'm exhausted from prepping for the insane variety of interview formats we face. Enough already! First, no company knows wtf they actually want, so we struggle just to land interviews. After 7 months of grinding applications, I realized I wasn't interview-ready and needed to brush up. But where to even start? DSA? ML fundamentals? Deep learning? Transformer architecture? LLM fine-tuning? RAGs? Vector databases? SQL? MLOps? The new agentic AI everyone's hyping??\n\nI've studied ALL of it and still have zero clue what I'll be asked. Then I learn this MBB-adjacent tech consulting firm uses CASE INTERVIEWS. Are you kidding me?  \nI was already burnt out and couldn't bring myself to prep properly. Still went through with it - interviewer was nice but I absolutely tanked it. Could identify the business problem but completely blanked on ML solutions. She pivoted to fundamentals when she saw me drowning, but classical ML is so rare nowadays I was rusty AF.\n\nWent in with zero expectations since I knew I didn't prep, figured it'd be practice. But now that it's over, I feel completely burnt out. That fire that made me quit my job 3 years ago to pivot into data science? Gone. All I have is a sore ass from trying to straddle multiple boats while desperately keeping up with this field. The interviewer mentioned she got mentored when she joined many years ago - must be nice! What early-career person knows how to nail technical case interviews end-to-end?\n\n*I'm not cut out for this. Feels like the folks who made it in the 2010s pulled the ladder up behind them.*\n\nCan someone please make me feel better?",
    "summary": "- **Company/Role:** MBB-adjacent tech consulting firm \n- **Rounds:** Case interview\n- **Difficulty:** High\n- **Questions:**\n    - Business problem identification\n    - ML solutions for the identified problem\n    - Classical ML fundamentals\n- **Tips:**\n    - Practice applying ML concepts to real-world business problems\n    - Review core ML fundamentals, including classical techniques\n    - Dedicate time to studying and practicing interview topics \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "I really sympathize with your position, but if you knew the interview format and still didn't prep at all, I'm not sure why you expected anything. The fact that you couldn't speak to anything on ML in general and particularly for classical techniques for a pretend business problem probably implies you haven't practiced enough to apply them to a real business problem. I'm not going to say you've been sitting on your ass for 7 months because I'm sure you haven't been, but all of the billion hypothetical interview topics you mentioned are things you SHOULD have a very strong familiarity with, either via using them in projects (which you should be doing anyways) or reviewing flashcards or whatever in your spare time (which takes 20 minutes a day; med schoolers do it, it's not difficult). Hiring is shit right now, much worse than it was a few years ago, and seems to only want the best of the best unicorns, but that isn't an excuse for you to have a seeming lack of knowledge of very basic core competencies; if anything, that should be more motivation to suck it up and start going through textbooks/tutorials/projects until you could do interviews in your sleep.",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad SDE Interview Experience (Outcome: Offer!!)\n\nHey everyone! Honestly can't even believe I'm writing with good news right now, I never in a million years thought this would happen to me. But this sub was really helpful to me while I was spiraling before receiving my offer, so hopefully I can help someone else by being transparent about my full process!\n\n# Timeline\n\nLate Februrary - Applied\n\nMid June - Received OA\n\nLate July - Received invitation to interview & availability survey (same day)\n\nAugust 4 - Loop\n\nAugust 7 - Offer\n\nAs you can see, the process was extremely slow and drawn out for me. I don't think this is typical, but I guess it can happen. When I received the OA, it was a total shock because I had assumed rejection after almost 4 months of silence. And then based on my performance in the OA, I assumed rejection again, so getting the interview was another huge shock :') But I've since learned that unless you specifically receive a rejection email, you're probably still in the running, no matter how long it's been. So have hope!\n\n# About Me & The Role\n\nI'm a May 2025 BSCS graduate from a slightly above-average private US university (not top tier but a handful of people land FAANG-level internships and jobs every year). I've had two previous internships, and both were at pretty mediocre companies. My GPA was good (graduated summa cum laude) and my projects were alright, but nothing amazing. I applied to the fungible SDE I New Grad position. So the way this position works is that you don't apply to a specific team or location. You just interview for a default SDE I position and if you pass the loop, they place you in a team afterwards. All I knew prior to my offer was that it was US-based, but no idea which specific location or team. If you'd like my exact job id, feel free to dm.\n\n# Online Assessment\n\nThe OA consisted of 2 DSA questions (I would say probably leetcode hard level), a work simulation, and a work style assessment. I did not do well on the coding part lol. I think I had TLE on a few test cases for the second problem, and I'm pretty sure my first problem's solution wasn't the cleanest either. I barely remember the questions and I obviously didn't get the optimal solutions so I can't tell you guys what concepts to study, sorry.\n\nHowever, I think the behavioral portion is weighted pretty heavily on this, considering I still got an interview despite that performance. At that point, I didn't know about Amazon's LPs, so I just answered everything honestly, and it worked out lol. But maybe brush up on the Leadership Principles if you want to prepare for the OA.\n\n# Final Loop\n\nI'm being purposely vague about the questions because I don't want to violate their policies. Please don't dm me asking exactly which questions I got. I don't think knowing that will help you much anyway, because the chances that you get the exact same ones I did are slim. Instead, I'll give you the broader concepts that they covered - make sure you practice a bunch of those types of problems, and you should be fine!\n\n**Round 1 (LP - probably bar raiser)**\n\nMy interviewer didn't have a technical background, which is why I assume he must have been the BR. The conversation was pretty casual; he told me at the start to try to respond in STAR format and use \"I\" statements rather than \"we\" - they're really looking for your specific contributions as an individual. Since I'm a recent grad, I drew most of my experiences from school projects, which I think is fine to do if you have limited industry experience. Be prepared for them to really dig into your answers. I got asked several follow-up questions for every story I told, so just make sure you actually know what you're talking about! He also often reiterated my own story to me to make sure he was representing me accurately, at which point I would either agree or elaborate with a few more points if I felt like he was missing any key details. At the end, we had time for me to ask him like 2 questions.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty decent about this round. I'm not sure how well I did at answering in STAR format because that's not something I've practiced a ton, but I tried to maintain a good balance of sharing enough details without getting way too granular (especially since my interviewer didn't know about the tech side of things). The interviewer was very nice but didn't give any clear indications as to how he thought I did.\n\n**Round 2 (LLD + DSA)**\n\nThis interviewer seemed much more serious than the first guy; we barely exchanged any pleasantries before we went straight into the coding problems.\n\nThe LLD problem I got was not as open-ended as \"design a parking lot\" - he gave me specific operations that the system had to accomplish, so there wasn't a ton of need for me to narrow the scope. It wasn't a problem I've seen before, but I guess kind of similar to the task management system or ATM. Again, smaller scope though. I think he was mainly looking for me to know what the appropriate data structures are to use, and to use them in a way that the code is extensible. I felt pretty good about my answer. I walked him through my thought process, implemented my initial design, then changed one data structure to another to optimize it. He asked me to explain the time and space complexity of each part of my code. I messed up here a little because I misremembered the time complexity of a certain operation on a data structure. (This was my biggest technical mistake throughout the whole loop. During the waiting game, I was feeling really bad about it - if you're in a similar situation, just remember that they don't expect you to be absolutely perfect, and everyone makes silly mistakes like that from time to time.) He asked a follow-up about how I would hypothetically extend my design to support another feature, which I explained but didn't code.\n\nThe DSA was like a leetcode medium graph traversal problem. I hadn't seen the exact problem before, but if you know one BFS/DFS problem, you kinda know them all. The approach was pretty clear, so I explained my thought process and then pretty much coded the whole thing out in one pass. He asked me to walk him through a test case, which I did, and then we ended the round with a few minutes of Q&A. I felt pretty good about this round overall too.\n\n**Round 3 (LP + DSA)**\n\nMy interviewer was an SDE II and not much older than me, so the conversation felt really relaxed. He only asked two behavioral questions and no follow-ups. I am currently working on a very interesting side project that I wanted them to know about, so I made sure to find a way to bring it up in this round since I couldn't in round 1 lol. He seemed very intrigued by it, so this round was off to a great start.\n\nThe DSA was another leetcode medium, this time a heap problem. It was very intuitive, so I explained my thought process and coded it out pretty quickly. He asked about optimizing a certain part of it, which I figured out could be done using a hash set. I did a dry run and explained the time and space complexity. We had a ton of time left, so he then asked me to write unit tests for it lol. After that, we still had like 20 minutes left, so we did a solid 5-10 minutes of Q&A/conversation, and then ended a little early. I think this round was probably my strongest - I got along super well with the interviewer and no hiccups at all!\n\n  \nAnd that was it! This is literally the only offer I got, but it only takes one! I was planning to go to grad school haha, I still can't believe that this is real life. I wish you all the best of luck with your interviews <3",

I understand the concepts but framing them and coming up with a story is something else. \n\nI have 2 weeks for the loop round and I feel less confident on system design although I have a decent understanding on the fundamentals and real world experience.\n\nMock interviews is something I am planning to schedule but tbh it all comes down to the interviewer. You can have a perfect mock interview with a systematic pattern (as outlined in HelloInterview) but end up having an impatient interviewer who probes you for deep dives even before you write down your functional/Non functional requirements. \n\nI am interviewing for an E5 round and after looking at Alex Wu and HelloInterview the amount of information is so vast to remember especially when you are expected to drive. I think at this point I am just going to pretend that the interview round is just a closed room meeting with my colleague and slow the interviewer down if he keeps probing me at least until I narrow down the high level designs.\n\nDoes anyone have any real experiences that you could share from the Meta E5 (especially with an impatient interviewer who constantly probes you at the early stage)",

        "body": "There comes a point where studying is no longer a substitute for experience, and interviewers can usually tell when your knowledge is theoretical as opposed to practical. That's why the probing questions are important.\n\nI did an E5 loop too and was down leveled to E4, I think largely because my SD knowledge is theoretical when it comes to massive scaling. \n\nThe thing to remember is that an interview isn't a test, it's an evaluation of your current competencies as well as your potential to grow. If you feel shaky on SD, study all you can but be realistic about what you actually know. It might be you're an E4, and that's ok.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" in an interview. It's ok not to know everything. But, that admission should be followed by some kind of reasoning process. For example, if you're asked what kind database you'll use but you don't know of a specific one that fits your needs, you could say, \"I'm not sure, but I know it needs to be write optimized, and probably NoSQL because the data isn't highly relational and we're going to deal with higher write frequency than read\"\n\nThis shows the interviewer that while you don't have the answer now, you have the criteria to find it. Nobody in this industry knows everything off the top of their head, but successful engineers know which questions to ask and how to find the answers, and that should be a positive signal for an interviewer.",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first.

Thus detailing them here in case it helps someone.\n\nI had both integration and bug bash rounds on the same day.\n\nIn Integration round, there's 4 sub-rounds. \nTo begin with, you're given a hello world boiler plate code and you're expected to call an API and print the response.\nThe request parameters are expected to be read from a file - so file parsing is essential.\nIn the second one, you're asked to parse the response and use it to call yet another API. \nThe subsequent rounds follows suit by increasing complexity in terms of forming the request and parsing the response.\n\nUse of an ide is permitted.\n\nThe challenge here is time since requirements change across sub-rounds and thus if the code is modular enough from the beginning, it helps.\n\nIn the bug bash round, you're given the entire repository of a built-in library, for instance, for python, it could be either \"requests\" or \"mako\". There'd be 4-5 unit tests failing and you'll be expected to run the tests one by one and make them pass by fixing the actual code.\n\nThe challenge here is again time since, if it is an unfamiliar library like mako, it is quite challenging to figure out what it does in the first place.\nUse of an IDE is permitted and is actually one of the evaluation parameters.\n\nI hope this helps!",

So frustrating.\n\nRight now, Idek what to do. Everyone says the same thing -- keep grinding, getting a job takes time, keep learning, keep moving forward, apply to startups, work for low pay if you have to. I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad? No clue.\n\nMy domain is also ridiculously saturated. I know Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices, but companies only want people with 4+ or 5+ years of experience. People keep telling me ----- \n\n“Do AI, it’s the buzzword right now.” I get it, and I’m not against it, but should I throw away my whole domain just because it’s trendy? I feel like I should incorporate AI into what I already know, not just switch blindly.\n\n\n\nBut honestly... it’s become repetitive and monotonous. Everywhere online it looks like everybody is getting jobs, building startups, tracking Y Combinator, whatever. I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.\n\nAnd here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. \n\nI’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. \n\nFreshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. \n\nJobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.\n\n\n\nI’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.\n\nAnd I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.\n\nIf someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.\n\nI never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.\n\nSo… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?\n\nAnd how's everything going for my fellow recent grads ....how's it for yall?",

In one, the interviewer didn’t want me to code but just explain the approach.\n\nI think my coding rounds went excellent, followed all meta expectations such as asking questions, communicating throughout and running multiple test cases etc.\n\nFor coding I’d suggest Stick to Meta tagged questions on Leetcode + Minhmer’s list. That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 Interview Experience\n\nThis was my first interview with a big tech company for an embedded role SDE1. I had my interview on Tuesday, and honestly, I was super nervous. Deep down, I had a gut feeling that things might not go well—and unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened.\n\n**Round 1**  \nTo my surprise, the first round was completely focused on Leadership Principles. I didn’t expect that at all. I actually had some solid stories prepared, but that alone wasn’t enough. The follow-up questions caught me off guard. My responses lacked depth, and I know I didn’t do well. I really fumbled through that part.\n\n**Round 2**  \nThis round went better—it even got extended by 30 minutes. It was a mix of coding and Leadership Principles. It started with “Tell me about yourself,” and then moved into a coding problem: I was given an expression like `\"23*9/3+1-19\"` and had to evaluate it. I explained my approach, wrote the code, and walked through a dry run. After that, he asked two LP questions. This time, I felt more mentally prepared. I was able to come up with stories on the spot and handle the follow-ups better.\n\n**Round 3**  \nThis one also felt like it went well and got extended (not sure how long exactly). We jumped straight into coding—the question was about finding a device with distinct identifiers. It was more like a networking-related problem, which I hadn’t prepared for. Still, I managed to approach it logically, and the interviewer seemed happy with both my approach and code. After that, he asked a few embedded systems-related questions, which I was able to answer.\n\nToward the end, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked about any technical challenges he faced in his role. He shared his experience, and then threw the same question back at me. I wasn’t ready for it, but I quickly adapted one of my past stories to fit. He seemed satisfied and even said, “Let’s see during training.”\n\nAfter the whole process, I had mixed feelings. I was disappointed in myself for messing up the first round but also felt somewhat hopeful about the other two. Sadly, I got the rejection email.\n\nRight now, I just feel angry, frustrated, and sad. I keep wondering why I choked in the first round. Should I even feel good about how the last two rounds went? I don’t know. Just mentally drained and needed to let it out.",

I have around 1 year 10 months FT experience but I also have multiple internships and TA experience, so I updated my experience as 2 years 6 months on the portal\n3.

I think getting a DSA buddy who could join me in a meeting and sit along with me for hours grinding the same problem then discussing the solutions without any cheating would make the experience of leetcoding 1000 times better.  \nI got to know about DSA back in dec 2024 I did learn some basics back then and solved around 30 leetcode questions. But I left doing those and started to focus on web development I grinded hard and got an internship as a fullstack web dev back in feb  2025 now after 6 months its ending.\n\nNow that I have already done an internship and I am in my final year I want to devote all my time to DSA since all the big tech companies have core focus on DSA rounds in the interviews. I have restarted doing leetcode around 1 month ago have done decent progress in last 1 month. If there's anybody beginner to intermediate in leetcode who is looking for a person to sit along with for hours grinding DSA you can directly connect to me through DMs. we will do proper research through all the big tech interviews analyze them properly do daily questions grind new topics do contests basically whatever it takes to crack those interview rounds and get a bumper high paying jobs 🤑\n\nFeel free to DM even if you have any other suggestions for me please provide your valuable insights or suggestions here.

I think getting a DSA buddy who could join me in a meeting and sit along with me for hours grinding the same problem then discussing the solutions without any cheating would make the experience of leetcoding 1000 times better.  \nI got to know about DSA back in dec 2024 I did learn some basics back then and solved around 30 leetcode questions. But I left doing those and started to focus on web development I grinded hard and got an internship as a fullstack web dev back in feb  2025 now after 6 months its ending.\n\nNow that I have already done an internship and I am in my final year I want to devote all my time to DSA since all the big tech companies have core focus on DSA rounds in the interviews. I have restarted doing leetcode around 1 month ago have done decent progress in last 1 month. If there's anybody beginner to intermediate in leetcode who is looking for a person to sit along with for hours grinding DSA you can directly connect to me through DMs. we will do proper research through all the big tech interviews analyze them properly do daily questions grind new topics do contests basically whatever it takes to crack those interview rounds and get a bumper high paying jobs 🤑\n\nFeel free to DM even if you have any other suggestions for me please provide your valuable insights or suggestions here.

    "raw": "Amazon SDE-1 interview experience - USA New grad\n\nHello...\n\nFirstly I wanted to thank the people of this subreddit. Most of the post from here helped me a lot to understand how the interview process of amazon would be and what can I expect. Since I took a lot from this subreddit, I wanted to give it back and I hope my experience helps any other who is preparing.\n\nTimeline:  \nApplied: June 18th, 2025  \nOA: Last week of June, don't exactly remember the date  \nInterview availability form: July 4th, 2025  \nInterview schedule: Initially all the 3 rounds were scheduled on July 24th, 2025, but then the 2nd and 3rd rounds were re-scheduled on Aug 4th, 2025 due to unavailability of interviewer.  \nAug 6th: Final decision - Reject\n\nExperience:  \nRound 1: LeetCode - Started with selft intro and directly jumped to coding. Initially the interviewer said we are going to do 2 coding exercises, but then I wasn't able to solve the 2nd question. I was able to identify the underlying concepts and what I need to do to solve the problem, but can't able to code it correctly. So he gave me another question to solve, which I solved quickly. First 2 questions were graph based but the last one was hashmap based, thus I solved 2/3 questions. All from medium level difficulty. 2 from NeetCode and one was not so famous problem but still from leetcode, which I wasn't able to solve. Finally I asked some questions to the interviewer about amazon and it ended.\n\nRound 2: Leadership Principles - The interviewer just drilled me with leadership principles questions along with follow up for 40 mins straight and then ended by me asking few questions to him. Went smooth.\n\nRound 3: LP + LLD - Started with self intro and 2 LP questions for about 20 mins. And then a LLD problem for 20 to 25 mins. I'm not getting into the details of what the question is. Not any famous LLD questions like parkingLot or pizza shop. It was different, but wasn't too difficult as well. Open to any language and focus is on design more than correctness. No need of working solution, but I was asked to think out loud and say all of my thought process as I code. Initially just gave a basic OOPs design for it, but as the interviewer added complexity, I changed that to a Builder pattern which he said it made sense to adapt.

I got into a good college recession was there no luck. I gave a lot of interviews. Reached 7th and 8th rounds in some companies....not even Google, but still 7 rounds and still got rejected. Some of the reasons were the stupidest possible. \n\nI’m not here to complain, but honestly......... I am just tired.\n\nGhosting is on another level. It is like they can’t even send a basic rejection mail. \n\nI gave 5 on-site interviews ...followed up and got “we’ll let you know,” and then silence forever. So frustrating.\n\nRight now, Idek what to do. Everyone says the same thing -- keep grinding, getting a job takes time, keep learning, keep moving forward, apply to startups, work for low pay if you have to. I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad? No clue.\n\nMy domain is also ridiculously saturated. I know Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices, but companies only want people with 4+ or 5+ years of experience. People keep telling me ----- \n\n“Do AI, it’s the buzzword right now.” I get it, and I’m not against it, but should I throw away my whole domain just because it’s trendy? I feel like I should incorporate AI into what I already know, not just switch blindly.\n\n\n\nBut honestly... it’s become repetitive and monotonous. Everywhere online it looks like everybody is getting jobs, building startups, tracking Y Combinator, whatever. I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.\n\nAnd here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. \n\nI’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. \n\nFreshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. \n\nJobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.\n\n\n\nI’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.\n\nAnd I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.\n\nIf someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.\n\nI never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.\n\nSo… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?\n\nAnd how's everything going for my fellow recent grads ....how's it for yall?",

My recruiter absolutely loved me and even helped feed me some answer she said would tick all the boxes her bosses wanted to see because I was her favorite candidate so far. Then passed the OA round. Went into a 4 round interview, the first three went fantastic, two of which were technicals that I breezed through, and ended up talking with the interviewers about more in depth topics like how the garbage collectors works and when does it activate, how to use more specialized classes like StringBuilder instead of string to optimize the technical question, etc, all of them said they were looking forward to meeting me again, then in my final interview with the manager he started by asking my questions like how big my family is, how close I am to them, what do my parents do for a job, how did I get my internships (not my experience during them or performance) but asking me if I got referrals etc, and then asked me to solve a leetcode but only use map and stream. The next day after that I got a rejection. This is a big company that was very professional leading up to that, should I let my recruiter know about this or is this normal?\nI’m can’t tell if I’m just frustrated because it was going so well and then so abruptly got a rejection, or if this genuinely a weird interview that I should talk to someone about.",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3. These are the resources and approaches I've personally used and recommend, I'm sure there are other good ones I am unaware of.\n4.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

After analyzing 200+ recent Google interview experiences from 2024-2025, one pattern shocked me: these 50 specific problems cover 87% of what's actually being asked in Google coding interview questions.\n\nThis isn't speculation. These patterns emerge from real interview reports, with specific problems appearing week after week in Google technical interview questions. The data shows clear tiers based on frequency, some problems appear in 42% of phone screens, others exclusively in L5+ final rounds.\n\n# The Context\n\nThis analysis covers L3-L6 positions based on reported experiences from January 2024 through August 2025. Google's interview patterns shifted significantly after their recent hiring freeze ended. The bar hasn't lowered, it's become more predictable.

Islands (200) and LRU Cache (146) dominate here, they appeared in 47% and 45% of phone screens respectively\n\n**Onsite Round 1-2:** Mix of Tier 1-2 with occasional Tier 3. The focus stays on clean implementation. Sliding window problems (340, 239) spike here\n\n**Onsite Round 3-4:** Tier 3-4 problems emerge. This is where Skyline (218) or Expression operators (282) separate L4 from L5+ candidates\n\n**Time Management:** Our data shows successful candidates average 25 minutes for Tier 1-2 problems, 35 minutes for Tier 3-4. Nobody expects perfect solutions for the hardest ones, clean approach with solid complexity analysis matters more\n\n# What's Changed in 2025\n\nComparing 2024 to 2025 Google technical interview questions, three shifts stand out:\n\n1. **Graph problems surged 30%** Union-find specifically jumped from 8% to 14% frequency. Problems like Redundant Connection (684, 685) moved from rare to regular\n2. **Pure DP decreased** Classic DP like Edit Distance dropped 40% in frequency. Google now prefers DP hidden within other patterns (Word Break, Target Sum)\n3. **Design hybrids exploded** LRU/LFU Cache, Serialize trees, Encode/Decode strings, these coding+design problems now appear in 35% of interviews, up from 20% last year\n\n# How to Use This List Effectively\n\nBased on successful candidate patterns:\n\n**Week 1-2:** Master Tier 1. These ten problems aren't just frequent, they teach the core patterns for everything else. Do each one three times: brute force, optimized, then from memory\n\n**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2. Focus on pattern recognition. When you see \"k distinct elements,\" think sliding window. \"Find median of stream\" always means two heaps\n\n**Week 5-6:** Sample Tier 3-4 based on your target level. L3-L4? Touch them lightly. L5+? These differentiate you\n\n**Daily routine:** Our data shows successful candidates practiced 3-4 problems daily, spending 2 hours. Quality beats quantity, understanding why approaches work matters more than solution count\n\n# The Resource\n\nFor those interested, we maintain a live database at [LeetWho.com](http://LeetWho.com) where we track actual Google coding interview questions as they're reported. It shows which problems appear in which rounds, when they were last asked, and what approaches work best. Gets updated weekly with new interview reports. The patterns become really clear when you see the actual frequency data.\n\nThe database includes solution patterns, time complexities Google accepts, and common follow-ups for each problem. Seeing \"\\[200\\] Islands follow-up: count distinct islands\" appearing in 23% of cases helps you prepare for the actual interview flow.",

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

In one, the interviewer didn’t want me to code but just explain the approach.\n\nI think my coding rounds went excellent, followed all meta expectations such as asking questions, communicating throughout and running multiple test cases etc.\n\nFor coding I’d suggest Stick to Meta tagged questions on Leetcode + Minhmer’s list. That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad SDE Interview Experience (Outcome: Offer!!)\n\nHey everyone! Honestly can't even believe I'm writing with good news right now, I never in a million years thought this would happen to me. But this sub was really helpful to me while I was spiraling before receiving my offer, so hopefully I can help someone else by being transparent about my full process!\n\n# Timeline\n\nLate Februrary - Applied\n\nMid June - Received OA\n\nLate July - Received invitation to interview & availability survey (same day)\n\nAugust 4 - Loop\n\nAugust 7 - Offer\n\nAs you can see, the process was extremely slow and drawn out for me. I don't think this is typical, but I guess it can happen. When I received the OA, it was a total shock because I had assumed rejection after almost 4 months of silence. And then based on my performance in the OA, I assumed rejection again, so getting the interview was another huge shock :') But I've since learned that unless you specifically receive a rejection email, you're probably still in the running, no matter how long it's been. So have hope!\n\n# About Me & The Role\n\nI'm a May 2025 BSCS graduate from a slightly above-average private US university (not top tier but a handful of people land FAANG-level internships and jobs every year). I've had two previous internships, and both were at pretty mediocre companies. My GPA was good (graduated summa cum laude) and my projects were alright, but nothing amazing. I applied to the fungible SDE I New Grad position. So the way this position works is that you don't apply to a specific team or location. You just interview for a default SDE I position and if you pass the loop, they place you in a team afterwards. All I knew prior to my offer was that it was US-based, but no idea which specific location or team. If you'd like my exact job id, feel free to dm.\n\n# Online Assessment\n\nThe OA consisted of 2 DSA questions (I would say probably leetcode hard level), a work simulation, and a work style assessment. I did not do well on the coding part lol. I think I had TLE on a few test cases for the second problem, and I'm pretty sure my first problem's solution wasn't the cleanest either. I barely remember the questions and I obviously didn't get the optimal solutions so I can't tell you guys what concepts to study, sorry.\n\nHowever, I think the behavioral portion is weighted pretty heavily on this, considering I still got an interview despite that performance. At that point, I didn't know about Amazon's LPs, so I just answered everything honestly, and it worked out lol. But maybe brush up on the Leadership Principles if you want to prepare for the OA.\n\n# Final Loop\n\nI'm being purposely vague about the questions because I don't want to violate their policies. Please don't dm me asking exactly which questions I got. I don't think knowing that will help you much anyway, because the chances that you get the exact same ones I did are slim. Instead, I'll give you the broader concepts that they covered - make sure you practice a bunch of those types of problems, and you should be fine!\n\n**Round 1 (LP - probably bar raiser)**\n\nMy interviewer didn't have a technical background, which is why I assume he must have been the BR. The conversation was pretty casual; he told me at the start to try to respond in STAR format and use \"I\" statements rather than \"we\" - they're really looking for your specific contributions as an individual. Since I'm a recent grad, I drew most of my experiences from school projects, which I think is fine to do if you have limited industry experience. Be prepared for them to really dig into your answers. I got asked several follow-up questions for every story I told, so just make sure you actually know what you're talking about! He also often reiterated my own story to me to make sure he was representing me accurately, at which point I would either agree or elaborate with a few more points if I felt like he was missing any key details. At the end, we had time for me to ask him like 2 questions.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty decent about this round. I'm not sure how well I did at answering in STAR format because that's not something I've practiced a ton, but I tried to maintain a good balance of sharing enough details without getting way too granular (especially since my interviewer didn't know about the tech side of things). The interviewer was very nice but didn't give any clear indications as to how he thought I did.\n\n**Round 2 (LLD + DSA)**\n\nThis interviewer seemed much more serious than the first guy; we barely exchanged any pleasantries before we went straight into the coding problems.\n\nThe LLD problem I got was not as open-ended as \"design a parking lot\" - he gave me specific operations that the system had to accomplish, so there wasn't a ton of need for me to narrow the scope. It wasn't a problem I've seen before, but I guess kind of similar to the task management system or ATM. Again, smaller scope though. I think he was mainly looking for me to know what the appropriate data structures are to use, and to use them in a way that the code is extensible. I felt pretty good about my answer. I walked him through my thought process, implemented my initial design, then changed one data structure to another to optimize it. He asked me to explain the time and space complexity of each part of my code. I messed up here a little because I misremembered the time complexity of a certain operation on a data structure. (This was my biggest technical mistake throughout the whole loop. During the waiting game, I was feeling really bad about it - if you're in a similar situation, just remember that they don't expect you to be absolutely perfect, and everyone makes silly mistakes like that from time to time.) He asked a follow-up about how I would hypothetically extend my design to support another feature, which I explained but didn't code.\n\nThe DSA was like a leetcode medium graph traversal problem. I hadn't seen the exact problem before, but if you know one BFS/DFS problem, you kinda know them all. The approach was pretty clear, so I explained my thought process and then pretty much coded the whole thing out in one pass. He asked me to walk him through a test case, which I did, and then we ended the round with a few minutes of Q&A. I felt pretty good about this round overall too.\n\n**Round 3 (LP + DSA)**\n\nMy interviewer was an SDE II and not much older than me, so the conversation felt really relaxed. He only asked two behavioral questions and no follow-ups. I am currently working on a very interesting side project that I wanted them to know about, so I made sure to find a way to bring it up in this round since I couldn't in round 1 lol. He seemed very intrigued by it, so this round was off to a great start.\n\nThe DSA was another leetcode medium, this time a heap problem. It was very intuitive, so I explained my thought process and coded it out pretty quickly. He asked about optimizing a certain part of it, which I figured out could be done using a hash set. I did a dry run and explained the time and space complexity. We had a ton of time left, so he then asked me to write unit tests for it lol. After that, we still had like 20 minutes left, so we did a solid 5-10 minutes of Q&A/conversation, and then ended a little early. I think this round was probably my strongest - I got along super well with the interviewer and no hiccups at all!\n\n  \nAnd that was it! This is literally the only offer I got, but it only takes one! I was planning to go to grad school haha, I still can't believe that this is real life. I wish you all the best of luck with your interviews <3",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",
    "summary": "- **Focus on clarity and conciseness:** Your resume should be easy to read and digest within 30 seconds.\n- **Highlight your most impressive achievements:**  Use your \"About\" section to explicitly state your strongest qualifications.\n- **Don't include irrelevant information:**  Leave out your GPA if it's below 3.8 and avoid listing every role at a company separately.\n- **Provide context for lesser-known companies:** Briefly describe the company and its achievements to help recruiters understand your experience.\n- **Be transparent about your work authorization status:**  State your eligibility to work in the US directly on your resume.\n- **Explain career changes:**  Clearly outline your transition to your current field and highlight relevant skills and achievements.\n- **ATS considerations:** Be mindful of formatting when listing multiple roles under one company, as ATS systems may have difficulty parsing it. \n\n\n",

    "raw": "Meta Code Screen – Passed!\n\nJust passed my first ever \"serious\" technical code screen with Leetcode-style problems. (I'd passed \"practical\" code screens that mostly tested general Python ability, but I'd never passed one where the bar was this high.) I figured I would share my experience.\n\nFirst, let me say that I won't give away the questions, but they were both in the top 50 tagged questions on Leetcode, no special variants whatsoever. I think officially one was listed as \"medium\" and the other as \"hard\", but both were on the easier end of those categories, and the \"medium\" one in particular is really an easy if you know the solution. The medium involved an array and a greedy solution and the \"hard\" (again, debatable) involved BFS / DFS on a grid. Not too bad. \n\nWhat went well for me was that I was very clear in explaining my thought process *before* I started coding. I wrote a commented-out high-level outline in the editor, asked my interviewer if this sounded like a good plan, and they agreed. Also, and this is important, I made sure to ask about empty input or any special cases, which they really liked. After the first problem I was asked to walk through an example to check correctness and I did.   \n  \nThe second problem (the DFS / BFS one) proceeded similarly: I outlined the solution, got buy-in, then implemented. In this case I forgot to ask about empty input (I didn't think the grid could be empty) but they asked me at the end how to handle that. I also missed incrementing a variable at one point and they mentioned that I had \"missed something\", but I was quick to identify it and thanked them for pointing it out, which probably helped my case.\n\nOnce it was over they asked me if I had any questions for them and I asked them about their projects and if overall they were happy with the work at Meta, and we had a nice little chat around that for a few minutes. I left feeling good.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience! Hope it helps! Now I have to pass the onsite... ",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

    "raw": "Interview Journey with Glean, Uber, etc For L5/Senior Roles\n\nHey, I am a Software Engineer based out of India with 5 YoE. I was helped immensely by a few of the online communities for my interview prep, so here’s something from my side to give back. I’ll briefly introduce myself, then go over two sections: the prep and the interviews (with their offer numbers, if offered). Gear up for a long (and hopefully helpful) post.\n\nSo a quick intro: I am a CS grad from a Tier-1 Indian college. I had been working at Google for around the past 3 years. I was an L4 and there were a few reasons I decided to leave (in no particular order):\n\n- Lack of good projects to get a promo. This was partly my fault and partly because there were too many L4s in my team.\n- My comp for 2025 was actually lower than 2024 due to front loaded stocks at the time of joining.\n- I was nearing 5 YoE which is good enough to get an L5 (or equivalent role) in most companies, so I decided I’ll leave Google if I get an L5 position at a company of my choice rather than waiting a year or so for the L5 promo at Google itself.\n\nCurrent TC:\n\n- Base: 41L\n- Yearly bonus: 8L\n- Stocks (to be vested in 2025): 30-35L (depending on where the stock is)\n- Total: 80-85L\n\n# The Prep\n\nI prepared for a total of 2-3 months with an average of 2-3 hours of daily studies/practice. According to my experience, there were a total of 4 kinds of rounds that companies ask (with some exceptions like Stripe). I’ll go over each one of them in the order of the time I invested for them.\n\n## System Design\n\nI spent the most amount of time on System Design prep. Partly because I thought for an L5, this should be the most important round and also because working at Google comes with the disadvantage that you’re cut off from the key technologies so much that you’ve to learn about them from scratch (although there are a lot of similar things in Google but there are quite a few differences too) and also because there’s so much to learn too. \n\nI will list down the resources I studied from and roughly in which order, but keep in mind that everyone will have a different requirement and might need more basic learning first or could skip some of the basic stuff too.\n\n1. Designing Data-Intensive Application Book: This is a classic textbook that I’d say one should read even if they’re not preparing for interviews, but especially if they are. It goes into the details of how databases work internally among other things. This is a great book for building fundamentals of the System Design.\n2. System Design Interview (Vol 1) by Alex Xu: This is a very beginner friendly book and explains terms like consistent hashing, CAP theorem, etc while solving some of the easier System design problems.\n3. Hello Interview website: This I’d say is the most important resource among all. Mainly because of the practice section in it. The practice sections have a bunch of questions (each with a solution written for it and most have videos too of solutions), where each question is split into multiple sub-questions that you’ve to answer one-by-one on which you get AI generated feedback. You’ve to buy a premium for this practice section, but I think it’s totally worth it. They also have reading material on the website which is quite helpful and is free.\n4. System Design Interview (Vol 2) by Alex Xu: In contrast to the first volume of the book, this goes into a lot of details of every problem, maybe sometimes more than what’d be needed for an interview and could be overwhelming, so only come to this when you’ve a good understanding of things. I only read a few chapters from this book. \n5. Some other resources that I considered and went through partly are:\n    1. ‘Jordan has no life’ channel’s Youtube playlists.\n    2. Some of Gaurav Sen’s YouTube videos.\n\nA few extra pointers that I’d like to give are:\n\n- Take good notes that you can go through again and again.\n- List down every topic that you want to prepare for (like reading SQL vs NoSQL, internals of Redis, etc) and make sure you check them all.\n- Follow a pattern/path during interviews. I followed the one that HelloInterview suggests: Listing function and non-functional requirements first, then core entities and rough API contract too. Then proceed to a HLD design with a basic structure handling all function requirements and then proceed to identify bottlenecks (non-functional reqs helps here) and solve them.\n\n## DSA\n\nThis I’d say most people are familiar with on how to prepare for. My plan was to solve top company tagged questions for the companies I was preparing for (this requires premium though). With this, there’s a good chance that you will get a few DSA questions in your interviews that you’ve already solved. \n\nMake sure you’ve gone through all the main topics too, like DP, graphs, two pointers, stack, binary search, etc.\n\n## LLD/Machine Coding\n\nI would say there’s a lack of very good resources for preparing for LLD rounds even though they are becoming increasingly important with time (as focus on DSA reduces). I’d break down the types of questions asked in LLD in 2 categories:\n\n1. Focused on implementation heavy DSA questions. These are questions like implement LRU cache, LC 432, etc.\n2. Focused on design principles. Learn design principles like SOLID, Strategy, Observer, Factory, Singleton, etc. Although I feel Big Tech (and good startups) don’t focus much on this, I could be wrong.\n\nThe focus of this round is to give working code quickly, and most optimal algorithm might not be needed always. There’s also emphasis on having good class structure with SOLID principles, code modularity, good variable naming, etc.\n\nOne resource I found helpful was awesome-low-level-design repo on github by ashishps1 which has solutions for a few famous problems in multiple languages. Christopher Okhravi's Design patterns playlist on YT is also good to learn design patterns (especially the first 6 videos).\n\nChoosing a language here is very important, as most people are familiar in Java OOPS but in C++ STL. For DSA, C++ STL is enough and OOPS is not needed, but LLD rounds require both. I chose Java because C++ requires memory management (there’s smart pointers but I didn’t want to get into that) so I had to learn Java equivalents for C++ STL and practice for it.\n\nWhile speed is important for every round, it is the most critical for these LLD rounds as companies want candidates who can give working code quickly.\n\n## Hiring Manager/Past Work\n\nThere are mainly two kinds areas of discussion here:\n\n- Your past work experience where the interviewer who is mostly the hiring manager goes into the details of your past projects (1 or 2). Make sure you choose a few projects (maybe just one project if it’s enough) that showcases your technical prowess in which you had to take some design decisions weighing the alternatives, maybe had junior engineers working with you (if you’re going for a Senior role) and worked with different stakeholders.\n    - To prepare for this, I did a mock round from Hello Interview (it’s expensive but the interviewer was very helpful and gave a few good pointers). Mock interviews are helpful in general, but more so for this round is what I feel.\n    - Make sure you have a diagram handy of the project you’re going to discuss here, maybe on Lucidchart.\n- General behavioral questions that I don’t think I need to go in detail here.\n\n# The Interviews\n\nA few pointers here before I proceed on my interview experiences:\n\n- List out the companies who want to go for and categorize them into “dream” and “target”. Once you’ve done some basic level of prep, you can start applying to the “target” companies while maybe tailoring your prep slightly to the company for which you’ve upcoming interviews (as sometimes these companies have slightly different procedures). It’s okay to be rejected from these companies, but important to gain experience and confidence from these rounds before starting to apply for “dream” companies.\n- Try to have competing offers in hand which can easily help you negotiate your salary by 10-20%. It’s a very important bargaining chip.\n\nI had the following list of dream companies:\n\n- Uber\n- Glean (an enterprise search software company)\n- Databricks\n- Stripe\n\nDatabricks generally needs more YoE for a Senior role and Stripe has a very unconventional interview procedure (debugging and API integrations rounds), so I thought of applying to Uber and Glean first and then going for the Databricks and Stripe if I don’t get into any one of the first two.\n\nAnd to practice I chose following companies:\n\n- Coinbase\n- Linkedin\n\n## Coinbase (IC5)\n\nI applied through their portal here. Their turnaround time was very quick and interviews were also scheduled very quickly.\n\n**OA round:** They had a DSA/implementation heavy round for OA. Clean code was not needed, only passing their tests was. Make sure you’re very quick with using sets, maps, etc. \n\nI passed the OA round and next up, three rounds were scheduled for main interview.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked to design a stockbroker for crypto. Went well I think but there were a few hiccups when I said I’d use Redis sorted sets to solve for something.\n\n**Tech Execution:** This was an LLD round only that I honestly fumbled because I wasn’t quick enough because of my lack of speed in using Java collections. Otherwise the round was not tough, just needed very quick implementations for the many parts there were to the problem.\n\n**Domain:** Again an LLD round which I was more prepared for after messing up the previous one and I think I did really well in this one.\n\n**Verdict:** Ghosted which I can assume meant No hire. In retrospect, I applied for this without any LLD prep (and then didn’t prepare much either for it). But it was okay as I didn’t want to go to Coinbase anyway and it was a good learning experience.\n\n## Linkedin (IC3)\n\nI applied via Linkedin only for this and again their turnaround time was very quick.\n\n**Screening round:** There was a LC medium and some CS basics questions. Went very well.\n\nI passed the screening round and then there were 4 rounds scheduled:\n\n**DSA 1 & 2:** Couple of LC medium questions in both. Were simple enough (and I actually had seen 1-2 of them on LC while practicing) and both rounds went well.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a slight modification of the famous ‘top-K articles/videos shared’ question. This round didn’t go very well partly because I wasn’t well prepared. The interviewer was also not very receptive to my points at times.\n\n**Past work/HM:** Mainly the round was focused on past complex projects I had worked on, of my choosing. Interviewer asked a few questions here and there on my choices. This round went quite well.\n\nRecruiter reached out to me saying that they want to take a repeat of System design round as it didn’t go well, but in office. I agreed, but stalled for 2-3 weeks because my Glean and Uber rounds had started, and also because I wanted some competing offer for Glean/Uber.\n\n**System Design Part 2:** Interviewer wanted to discuss my team’s overall architecture for first half which went quite well and second half was for a quick system design question which went well I’d say.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. \n\n**TC:** Initially they had said they can give a max of 95L-1Cr for a Senior role, but by this time I already had the Glean offer so they were willing to go up to 1.15 Cr but I declined. This TC includes all the components (base they were offering was 65L).\n\n## Glean (Lead/Senior role)\n\nThis was the main company I was preparing for, mostly because of the future share value potential and amazing talent density. I was lucky that the recruiter only reached out to me at the right time. I only replied when I was confident with my prep though.\n\n**HM round:** A brief 30 mins round for intros and about what I’ve worked on in the past. Don’t think this was supposed to be a hire/no-hire decision round.\n\nThere were a total of 4 rounds after that:\n\n**DSA 1&2:** Both rounds had LC medium-hard questions with a hard followup. There was a good discussion in both and interviewers were quite receptive of my ideas. In one of the rounds, my solution was optimal but would have led to a lengthy implementation so there the interviewer suggested a slightly different approach which I hoped on quickly. Both the rounds went quite well but I felt they could’ve been slightly better due to different reasons.\n\n**Past Work:** I was well prepared for this with diagrams handy to explain quickly. Round was supposed to last for 60 mins but interviewer was happy with me and the round ended in 45 mins with last 5-10 mins going into ‘Why leave Google’ kind of questions.\n\n**LLD round:** This was a 120 min round that I was honestly a little nervous about because I didn’t know what to expect, but it was a typical implementation round just with more parts to it. I wrote good modular code with SOLID principles (especially the S part of it). Any other design principles were not needed but I needed to be quick and was able to complete all the parts. I did later notice after the round that in the last sub-part I had not handled one case (because I had not read the question properly), but not sure if the interviewer noticed that.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. They did not let me negotiate as I didn’t have any competing offers at the time (Linkedin was there but they were giving lesser comp so that didn’t matter), and also because they strongly felt that the comp they were offering was quite good. \n\n**TC:** 65 base and 5000 RSUs (not ESOPs) to be vested equally in 4 years. Their share value according to the last funding round is around 50$, so that means around 55L per year, bringing total comp to around 1.2 Cr (they don’t have any bonuses).\n\n## Uber (L5)\n\nRecruiter had reached out to me. I replied back when I was confident with my prep.\n\n**Screening:** A DSA question of LC medium difficulty that I was able to answer quickly and then some discussion happened about my past work.\n\nI passed the screening and there were 4 rounds scheduled after that:\n\n**DSA:** I didn’t find the interviewer very good for this round. The first two questions he gave me were known to me which I told him (not sure why XD, as I’ve not done that in the past). He gave a different question after that which he maybe wasn’t prepared for as there were a lot of edge cases in it (especially in the followup) and I guess the question was new to him too. I solved the main part quickly but didn’t get a lot of time for the followup’s edge cases but I did give some hand-wavy solution. A lot of time was wasted in this round in the beginning in changing the questions and interviewer had a meeting after that so he didn’t extend the interview.\n\n**LLD:** Interview asked me a LC medium DSA question only for this which I was able to solve quickly and we had some chat about my past work after that.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a Ad click aggregator similar question. Interview went above average, not the best but I felt it was passable.\n\n**Past Work/HM:** This was a 90 mins round. First 50 mins went into a past project discussion which I felt went well but not sure if the interviewer felt the same. Next 40 mins went into behavioral questions which I felt went good but then at the end interviewer asked me why am I not waiting to become L5 at Google before looking for L5 opportunity elsewhere (which I felt was a stupid question because why not?), I said I feel I’m L5 ready but won’t become L5 for a year more in Google. We had a bunch of to and fro on that where I felt she was not very happy with some of my answers.\n\n**Verdict:** Recruiter told me that they want to take a repeat of the HM round, but as I had already gotten the Glean offer and that being my first preference I declined.\n\nSo yeah, joining Glean now! Feel free to ask questions and I’d love to answer as many as I can. But please don’t ask the specific questions that were asked in the interviews to me.",

The interview took around 1 hour exact. I believe this is taken by a Bar Raiser. He asked all the possible followups. ( interviewer had  27 years of experience)\nI did answer everything perfectly with explanation.\n\n2nd round ( Coding ) - I had two coding questions- medium level. I finished the coding for both with followups. (Both within the timelimit finished )\n\n3rd round ( LLD Design ) - i was asked 2 LPs and got around 25 mins to write a LLD code. I did write the entire code. Although there were few hiccups as interviewer was expecting me to write a particular code and I told him I will surely get over there. I missed one class and when interviewer pointed out I immediately coded even though he was just fine for me to explain the missing part. The round ended while I just 2 mins left for me to ask questions. \n\n\nWhats your take on my interview.  Do let me know your views and I'm happy to answer any questions you guys have. \n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n",

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

This round I felt 50/50 on; I think my first answer came off as too esoteric and not very clear because I wanted to discuss a highly technical project I finished in school but perhaps some of it went over the interviewers head due to lacking communication on my end. Rest of the stories I answered with experiences building projects at my internship, and I felt like I smashed those pretty well. Though results speak otherwise...\n\nInterview 2: Two LPs, and an LC medium with followup. LPs were pretty easy, I focused on previous work experience again which I felt worked better than my school stories. LC I solved with some but not too many hints in optimal time, got the followup in optimal time as well. Probably smoothest round.\n\nInterview 3: 2 LCs. First one was a very common interview question that Amazon asks, solved it optimally and got good feedback from interviewer. I lowkey dropped the ball on the 2nd LC, wasn't actually that hard. It was a tree Q, thinking back should have been a slam-dunk but waffled because I wasn't exactly sure what the problem at hand was and the interviewer had explained it in a way that was not very intuitive (understandable to not give away answer). Eeked out an optimal solution with explanation of time complexity. Looking back, I probably missed a positive data point because I wasn't able to move onto a 3rd LC.\n\nVerdict: Rejected today, 4 business days later.

Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?\n\n  \nP.S. Sorry for the long post.",

If you feel shaky on SD, study all you can but be realistic about what you actually know. It might be you're an E4, and that's ok.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" in an interview. It's ok not to know everything. But, that admission should be followed by some kind of reasoning process. For example, if you're asked what kind database you'll use but you don't know of a specific one that fits your needs, you could say, \"I'm not sure, but I know it needs to be write optimized, and probably NoSQL because the data isn't highly relational and we're going to deal with higher write frequency than read\"\n\nThis shows the interviewer that while you don't have the answer now, you have the criteria to find it.

Then we headed into the LLD which felt extremely straight forward and simple only having to implement one class and two methods, but I was super slow and I started off not saying much and towards the end of the time he pointed out some things that could raise potential errors which I promptly fixed. Finished implementing with only a few minutes left and he emphasized wanting to ask a follow up, which I answered, and then last minute asked if I had any questions for him. Didn't feel very confident with this one because I think the question was meant to be simple with a lot of follow ups to implement if I was better and more efficient. (6/10)\n* Round 2:  Bar Raiser - Asked 3 LP questions with follow ups in this round for 30 minutes, which I feel like overall went well except one part where he a specific semi-technical question about webhooks which I kind of blanked on because the project was a while ago, and he just said it was ok and moved on to the next question. This part by far I felt the worst about, and kind of lost confidence when asked about how I felt about my impact and the preparation I took to learn how to develop an API. Last 30 minutes he let me ask him questions. (5/10\n* Round 3: Non tagged LC Question - This by far I felt was my best round, but only because I won the lottery with the question it felt really simple even though I had never seen it before. I learned from my LLD round to start talking through my thoughts, so I started by describing between 2 approaches I'd use and describing their time complexity. After explaining why the 2nd would be better, interviewer said to go ahead and implement and I explained my thinking throughout. Solution was valid, but interviewer asked if it could further be optimized. Went through two more optimizations, the 2nd one being the most optimal and he gave me a slight hint on but it was not an easily apparent one so I felt ok with the small hint. I was taking some time to implement the search algorithm, but he seemed like he was satisfied because he said it was ok since the logic was all there, and with the last 25 minutes he let me ask him questions.

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 New Grad -US Interview ( Stressed out about the final verdict)\n\nI recently completed my Amazon SDE-1 New Grad (US) interview process, on July 24 and I have been very stressed out how the final outcome would be. I’d really appreciate your suggestions or feedback on my experience.\n\nRound 1 : (Bar Raiser)\nIn the first round, I performed exceptionally well. I engaged with the interviewer throughout the conversation and provided lengthy, well-structured responses using the STAR format and standard interviewing techniques. The interviewer was genuinely intrigued by some of my projects and went deep into the details during follow-ups. I believe I did well in this round. I even asked a few impressive questions to the interviewer and expressed my enthusiasm for joining Amazon. I also mentioned how comfortable I felt throughout the interview process.\n\nRound 2: (LP+ LLD)\nIn the second round, I was asked to present a project and discuss its technical aspects. I presented my project well and answered the interviewer’s questions thoroughly. I felt confident in my abilities and believed I had done well in this round as well.\nSimilar to the previous rounds, my LPs performed exceptionally well. I even came up with unique stories for different projects, different from the I used in Round 1. The interviewers were impressed by the research-based projects and decisions I made in my past endeavors. One of the interviewers posed technical questions about my projects, and I responded with a well-structured STAR format. Overall, my LP was good.\n\nThen comes the LLD, which seems to be a very small task and not something I’ve seen anywhere before. I started by listing out all the requirements and key features, then came up with solutions. I designed my drafted version, explained what I had done, and then gave a modified and better version of my modules based on the frequently changing requirements. I feel like I’ve done what I’ve been asked, except the design isn’t in OOD format because the task wasn’t in that format. Then, the Shadow asked me to identify the bugs and mentioned that there’s an edge case missing in it. I debugged my code but couldn’t find that edge case. I had mixed feelings for this round for my LLD. However, I feel like I’ve been actively communicating and keeping track of the requirements while coding it.\n\nRound 3 (Technical):\nDirectly jumped into the DSA and gave me two modified Leetcode-style questions.\n\nQuestion 1: It’s a variant of the Top k frequent items in a list problem, but with various edge cases and string manipulations involved. I gave my brute force approach and explained why it’s not a good solution. Then, I presented the hash map-based approach with two possible solutions: sorting by values or using a heap. I analyzed the complexities of both approaches. I implemented a fully working code, and the interviewer gave a small follow-up. I fixed my code to that change. Overall, he seemed satisfied.\n\nQuestion 2: With only 25 minutes left, the interviewer asked me to explain the solution while coding. It was a challenging LC graph question. I quickly came up with a solution because it was a combination of graph traversal and backtracking. I explained the question and started coding while talking. My pseudocode was fully executable and easy to understand. He asked me to explain the solution using the test case, and I explained the code. I quickly ran through the test case and gave the solution. I accidentally made the question a bit harder while asking the interviewer about the requirements, and my solution worked for it. Overall, he seemed satisfied with my approach. However, I made a mistake when he asked about the complexity of my code. I wasn’t entirely sure about it. But what I said was right when I checked after the interview. He then asked some follow-up questions about my approach and other technical questions related to it, and I answered them well. I feel confident about my performance in this round.\n\nI’m so stressed out about my final verdict. Based on your experiences, how would you rate this interview? Am I having a chance?\n\nEDIT : I got rejection today. I’m totally devastated after this decision, even after doing my best and performing well. At this point, I don’t even understand what they’re even looking in a New Grad. Anyway, thanks for all your support and reaching out. Good luck with your Job hunt!!",

Luckily he went on vacations and provided me with a substitute, who was very transparent about the levelling and clarified that the loop was initially set at L3. Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4.

    "raw": "How do you get through the inital months of not feeling ready for OAs?\n\nApologizes if this is a dumb question, but I was wondering how yall got yourselves out of the negative feedback loop of not feeling ready to take on actual technical interviews because you haven't practice enough yet in the beginning of your LC journey. I started my leetcode journey at the beginning of summer, I felt like I would easily get burnt out if I was spending hours studying, so I just consistently do about 20-30 minutes a day, just do one problem a day. I have been following [algomap.io](http://algomap.io) cus I like the way they visualize the answer before coding, I totally feel like a beginner still, I’ve managed to get a couple easy questions done by myself, but majority of the medium questions I could not get the answer at all after 20 minutes. In terms of schooling, I am in my last semester, so I still have time to develop my skills before rushing to get a job. But the reason I asked this question is because I recently got the invitation to do the first round OA for Capitol One. If I am being honest, I know I’m not going to do well based off how I’m doing in LC. I am still going to take it for the experience, but I’m in this constant negative loop where I don’t feel ready to take these OAs, but I need to apply to jobs, I do need a job, I don’t want to wait till I graduate to start applying. That’s why I wanted to ask how do yall get through the initial months of not feeling ready at all? I’ve been trying to slowly increase the amount of studying I need to do, I’ve been slowly started liking LC, but I have a lot of moments where if I am totally lost, I just lose all motivation to even try. So, any advice would be greatly appreciative. Thank you.\n\n",

    "raw": "Feeling like a fluke in my cs internship\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m currently in a bit of a tough spot. I’m a CS major and wanted to get experience in software engineering, so I took an internship at a small finance company. The issue is, they don’t really have any tech people or mentors — they just handed me a project and told me to build a full web app (frontend and backend) from scratch. I don’t have much experience, so I’ve been relying a lot on AI to help me get through most of it.\n\nMy boss knew from the start that I only had very basic experience, but I don’t think she fully understands how difficult it is to actually build and launch a full MVP app — especially as a solo intern. She keeps throwing new feature ideas at me, expecting me to build both the frontend and backend, and it’s honestly overwhelming.\n\nI’ve been using AI to help me get through most of it — I understand the code and I do have to edit it and debug it a lot of times to work (so I do get the gist of things) and can explain what it’s doing, but I wouldn’t be able to write a lot of it from scratch without help. Because the expectation is to deliver a working product, I haven’t really had the time or space to sit down and actually learn things deeply — it’s all about output right now.\n\nI’m a rising sophomore, and I’m worried about how to talk about this experience when applying to future internships. On paper, I can say I helped build an app, but in reality, AI played a huge role. I just feel kind of like a fraud, even though I’ve been trying my best for my context, and I really do want to learn.\n\nAlso — I’m pretty sure she’s going to ask me to keep working during the school year to keep maintaining or expanding the app. Based on how things have gone so far, I’m not sure that’s a good idea. It feels like the workload will just keep growing, and since she doesn’t have experience in tech, it’s hard for her to gauge what’s realistic, and I'll just be stuck in this cycle of never learning things properly.\n\nWould love any advice, especially if you've been in a similar spot, on how I should approach future applications and internships and what to say for my interviews etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But here are two points that come to mind when you asked ur question:\n\n1. **Talk to your manager**: If AI is something that’s allowed at your company or it’s common practice, I’d definitely bring it up to her, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed and relying on it to get things done. You could mention that you’ve been using an internal AI tool to help a lot to help with coding, but you’re feeling like there’s still a gap in your knowledge you want to fill. If AI isn’t something your company uses, obviously don't say you've chatted a lot of it, but you could still bring it up when she assigns new tasks and just be upfront saying I'm not sure how to approach it, do you have any resources or someone in the company I could turn to if I have questions. \n2. **In interviews**: For future internships, don’t be hard on yourself for using AI, especially in today’s job market where AI is *everywhere* and it's *so difficult* to get an interview or job. Do not diminish the work you did by saying AI did a lot of it. And yeah, the only potential downside is if you’re asked to explain things in a more technical interview setting where you might need to go deeper. But honestly, just study, and you’ll be fine.",

You can tell your boss that while you’re interested in continuing to work there, you feel the amount of work you’re expected to do and the quality/breadth of it (solo developing a full stack app for a financial firm is no easy feat) doesn’t quite match up to the salary, and you think you deserve higher compensation. Come into that conversation with full confidence given to you by the knowledge that a) you’re completely in the right and valid for feeling overwhelmed by this high level project as an intern and b) you’ll be completely okay if she says no and you go elsewhere. \n\nEither that or just begin searching for something else and leave. Just because she’s made the mistake of expecting an intern to code an entire app for the firm doesn’t mean you have responsibility to fix that assumption. \n\nAlso, frankly, if the AI is working for what you’re doing, you’re still understanding the code and debugging as you go, and you’re making sure to do lots of validation and verification testing to ensure no major problems or security flaws will ever be pushed to production… just keep using it.

I believe that helping people solve math problems will deepen my own understanding, and although I’m not tutoring discrete math (DM/DMS) which ties in closer to CS concepts, I think my experience will give me a rock-solid understanding of some of the concepts upon which DM is based on, which would help when I formally enroll in a DM class.\n\n2. This experience may help me get an internship in an actual CS field. Even though it’s not CS experience, I think it does count as STEM experience (tell me if I’m wrong). Practicing explaining mathematical concepts and walking people through problems is something I could imagine directly transferring as a soft-skill in the CS world.\n\nI would be interested to hear some opinions on the impact this may have on my chances of securing a CS internship in the future.",

The next day after that I got a rejection.

    "raw": "Feeling like a fluke in my cs internship\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m currently in a bit of a tough spot. I’m a CS major and wanted to get experience in software engineering, so I took an internship at a small finance company. The issue is, they don’t really have any tech people or mentors — they just handed me a project and told me to build a full web app (frontend and backend) from scratch. I don’t have much experience, so I’ve been relying a lot on AI to help me get through most of it.\n\nMy boss knew from the start that I only had very basic experience, but I don’t think she fully understands how difficult it is to actually build and launch a full MVP app — especially as a solo intern. She keeps throwing new feature ideas at me, expecting me to build both the frontend and backend, and it’s honestly overwhelming.\n\nI’ve been using AI to help me get through most of it — I understand the code and I do have to edit it and debug it a lot of times to work (so I do get the gist of things) and can explain what it’s doing, but I wouldn’t be able to write a lot of it from scratch without help. Because the expectation is to deliver a working product, I haven’t really had the time or space to sit down and actually learn things deeply — it’s all about output right now.\n\nI’m a rising sophomore, and I’m worried about how to talk about this experience when applying to future internships. On paper, I can say I helped build an app, but in reality, AI played a huge role. I just feel kind of like a fraud, even though I’ve been trying my best for my context, and I really do want to learn.\n\nAlso — I’m pretty sure she’s going to ask me to keep working during the school year to keep maintaining or expanding the app. Based on how things have gone so far, I’m not sure that’s a good idea. It feels like the workload will just keep growing, and since she doesn’t have experience in tech, it’s hard for her to gauge what’s realistic, and I'll just be stuck in this cycle of never learning things properly.\n\nWould love any advice, especially if you've been in a similar spot, on how I should approach future applications and internships and what to say for my interviews etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

You could mention that you’ve been using an internal AI tool to help a lot to help with coding, but you’re feeling like there’s still a gap in your knowledge you want to fill. If AI isn’t something your company uses, obviously don't say you've chatted a lot of it, but you could still bring it up when she assigns new tasks and just be upfront saying I'm not sure how to approach it, do you have any resources or someone in the company I could turn to if I have questions. \n2. **In interviews**: For future internships, don’t be hard on yourself for using AI, especially in today’s job market where AI is *everywhere* and it's *so difficult* to get an interview or job. Do not diminish the work you did by saying AI did a lot of it. And yeah, the only potential downside is if you’re asked to explain things in a more technical interview setting where you might need to go deeper. But honestly, just study, and you’ll be fine.",

Come into that conversation with full confidence given to you by the knowledge that a) you’re completely in the right and valid for feeling overwhelmed by this high level project as an intern and b) you’ll be completely okay if she says no and you go elsewhere. \n\nEither that or just begin searching for something else and leave. Just because she’s made the mistake of expecting an intern to code an entire app for the firm doesn’t mean you have responsibility to fix that assumption. \n\nAlso, frankly, if the AI is working for what you’re doing, you’re still understanding the code and debugging as you go, and you’re making sure to do lots of validation and verification testing to ensure no major problems or security flaws will ever be pushed to production… just keep using it.

    "raw": "2024 Grad, 1 Year Gap, 0 Offers  where Do I Even Go From Here?\n\nI completed my master’s around August 2024, so it’s been almost a year now. 2023 and 2024 were just… I don’t know man. I got into a good college recession was there no luck. I gave a lot of interviews. Reached 7th and 8th rounds in some companies....not even Google, but still 7 rounds and still got rejected. Some of the reasons were the stupidest possible. \n\nI’m not here to complain, but honestly......... I am just tired.\n\nGhosting is on another level. It is like they can’t even send a basic rejection mail. \n\nI gave 5 on-site interviews ...followed up and got “we’ll let you know,” and then silence forever. So frustrating.\n\nRight now, Idek what to do. Everyone says the same thing -- keep grinding, getting a job takes time, keep learning, keep moving forward, apply to startups, work for low pay if you have to. I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad? No clue.\n\nMy domain is also ridiculously saturated. I know Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices, but companies only want people with 4+ or 5+ years of experience. People keep telling me ----- \n\n“Do AI, it’s the buzzword right now.” I get it, and I’m not against it, but should I throw away my whole domain just because it’s trendy? I feel like I should incorporate AI into what I already know, not just switch blindly.\n\n\n\nBut honestly... it’s become repetitive and monotonous. Everywhere online it looks like everybody is getting jobs, building startups, tracking Y Combinator, whatever. I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.\n\nAnd here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. \n\nI’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. \n\nFreshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. \n\nJobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.\n\n\n\nI’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.\n\nAnd I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.\n\nIf someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.\n\nI never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.\n\nSo… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?\n\nAnd how's everything going for my fellow recent grads ....how's it for yall?",

    "raw": "Does having one SWE internship make getting future internships easier?\n\nRising 3rd year, just finished my first SWE internship at a pretty-big-deal startup. According to my boss and all my coworkers, I made an impressive impact while I was there, and I just loved the experience overall!\n\nBut as fall is coming around, I'm extra nervous about tech recruiting for next summer. I got my first internship through a lot of networking and a behavioral interview, nothing technical beyond the projects / experiences on my resume. I want to try aiming for Big Tech or a bigger company (though I wouldn't be opposed to interning at another startup either), and it feels like I'm facing a boss fight.\n\nHow do I know if my experience is \"enough\" for these roles compared to other candidates? I'm proud of what I did at the startup, but all my fellow CS majors have way more impressive sounding internship descriptions than me. Technical interviews sound extremely terrifying (like I have to code on the spot while someone watches me??). I also transferred into the CS major a bit late and I'm often insecure about being \"behind.\"\n\nI'm paranoid that my first internship was a fluke, and I'll never get an opportunity like that again. Are recruiters more likely to consider your resume if you've had a prior SWE internship on there? \n\nAny encouragement or advice would help a lot! Aside from just grinding LeetCode and maybe another personal project, I'm not really sure what to do. :((",

Went into a 4 round interview, the first three went fantastic, two of which were technicals that I breezed through, and ended up talking with the interviewers about more in depth topics like how the garbage collectors works and when does it activate, how to use more specialized classes like StringBuilder instead of string to optimize the technical question, etc, all of them said they were looking forward to meeting me again, then in my final interview with the manager he started by asking my questions like how big my family is, how close I am to them, what do my parents do for a job, how did I get my internships (not my experience during them or performance) but asking me if I got referrals etc, and then asked me to solve a leetcode but only use map and stream. The next day after that I got a rejection. This is a big company that was very professional leading up to that, should I let my recruiter know about this or is this normal?\nI’m can’t tell if I’m just frustrated because it was going so well and then so abruptly got a rejection, or if this genuinely a weird interview that I should talk to someone about.",

My recruiter absolutely loved me and even helped feed me some answer she said would tick all the boxes her bosses wanted to see because I was her favorite candidate so far. Then passed the OA round. Went into a 4 round interview, the first three went fantastic, two of which were technicals that I breezed through, and ended up talking with the interviewers about more in depth topics like how the garbage collectors works and when does it activate, how to use more specialized classes like StringBuilder instead of string to optimize the technical question, etc, all of them said they were looking forward to meeting me again, then in my final interview with the manager he started by asking my questions like how big my family is, how close I am to them, what do my parents do for a job, how did I get my internships (not my experience during them or performance) but asking me if I got referrals etc, and then asked me to solve a leetcode but only use map and stream. The next day after that I got a rejection. This is a big company that was very professional leading up to that, should I let my recruiter know about this or is this normal?\nI’m can’t tell if I’m just frustrated because it was going so well and then so abruptly got a rejection, or if this genuinely a weird interview that I should talk to someone about.",

L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?",

    "raw": "Please advise for Jane Street final round w/ no interview experience\n\nI'll preface this by saying I feel incredibly fortunate to be in this position, but I have a final round interview in person for Jane Street next week and am pretty terrified. I'm first gen/low income, so this is a life-changing opportunity not just for me but for my family as well and I feel obligated to throw everything I have at it. Essentially how I got here is that previously I've been fortunate enough to be part of a first generation college program at a FAANG company that provided an internship the past two summers, and I saw the trading salaries and figured I had to give it a shot. I've done some Leetcode on and off for the first time over the past month, and my first ever live coding interview was Jane Street's first round last week, which I luckily managed to pass. I saw online about the overall structure of the full-day interview with multiple rounds before/after lunch, and honestly just feel so scared that such a life-changing opportunity is so close yet I probably will end up blowing it since I have so much less interview experience/knowledge than all of the insanely talented people applying. So, I decided why not make a Reddit account and ask people who might actually know something because literally anything would help. Might be shouting into the void, but is the style similar to the first round interview or do they bring in more Leetcode-style questions or systems/other questions outside general coding implementation? Also, to adjust my own and familial expectations, about what percent of people make it through final round? Literally any other info also helps, happy to also answer questions if this does get any answers! Thanks so much!",

The next day after that I got a rejection. This is a big company that was very professional leading up to that, should I let my recruiter know about this or is this normal?\nI’m can’t tell if I’m just frustrated because it was going so well and then so abruptly got a rejection, or if this genuinely a weird interview that I should talk to someone about.",

I’ve been doing all of that for a year. Still, no luck. Almost everyone I know from my college batch is also jobless right now. So is it the industry? Is the market just that bad?

I’m not pissed at them i do know that everyone has their own pace ...but for me it’s just hard to navigate now.\n\nAnd here’s the real kicker ,, I’m almost out of every hiring bracket. \n\nI’m a 2024 graduate, so 2025/2026 hiring drives won’t even consider me. \n\nFreshers jobs want people with an internship or 6 months experience I have none. \n\nJobs for 0–1 year of experience also reject me because I now have a “1-year gap with no experience.” So yeah, out of that bracket too.\n\n\n\nI’ve reached out to so many people on LinkedIn, on remote work platforms, on every global job site I know but well ......no luck. No freelancing gigs, no startups, nothing. Some companies reject for such weird reasons that I can’t even understand what they want anymore.\n\nAnd I’m not confused, but I’m exhausted. My confidence in interviews is gone. After a year of this you just lose that energy of prepping for DS/Algo interviews, solving LeetCode, memorizing textbook answers. Now if I got an interview tomorrow, I genuinely think I wont make it........not because I can’t do the work, but because I’m just out of touch with the whole process.\n\nIf someone hired me, I’d get the job done, no questions. But if they ask me to prove it through 3–4 rounds, I feel like saying, “You know what? Just don’t give me the job, it’s fine.” That’s where my head’s at now.\n\nI never sat idle..I kept learning, did what hands-on work I could at my level. But it’s just getting heavier and heavier to carry this on. And yeah, I’m even willing to do grunt work, the shitty work, if it’s in my domain—Java, Spring Boot, backend. No whining, no complaints. I just need a place to start. But after a year, I still haven’t got that start.\n\nSo… for anyone who’s been in my shoes.....any senior who's in the industry ...who knows this , has faced it .....how did you come out of it? What did you do? How did you make things better?\n\nAnd how's everything going for my fellow recent grads ....how's it for yall?",

Did it feel super stressful or more chill than expected?\n* How strict are they about getting the coding questions *completely* right? Is there room for partial credit or discussion if you get stuck?\n* Do they focus more on problem-solving approach, or do they expect clean, optimized code from the jump?\n* What kind of behavioral questions should I really be ready for? Any common themes or curveball questions?\n* What’s something you wish you knew before going into the interview?\n* And finally, any must-know resources or practice problems that helped you crush it?",

    "raw": "Am I being unrealistic? L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?",

    "raw": "Feeling like a fluke in my cs internship\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m currently in a bit of a tough spot. I’m a CS major and wanted to get experience in software engineering, so I took an internship at a small finance company. The issue is, they don’t really have any tech people or mentors — they just handed me a project and told me to build a full web app (frontend and backend) from scratch. I don’t have much experience, so I’ve been relying a lot on AI to help me get through most of it.\n\nMy boss knew from the start that I only had very basic experience, but I don’t think she fully understands how difficult it is to actually build and launch a full MVP app — especially as a solo intern. She keeps throwing new feature ideas at me, expecting me to build both the frontend and backend, and it’s honestly overwhelming.\n\nI’ve been using AI to help me get through most of it — I understand the code and I do have to edit it and debug it a lot of times to work (so I do get the gist of things) and can explain what it’s doing, but I wouldn’t be able to write a lot of it from scratch without help. Because the expectation is to deliver a working product, I haven’t really had the time or space to sit down and actually learn things deeply — it’s all about output right now.\n\nI’m a rising sophomore, and I’m worried about how to talk about this experience when applying to future internships. On paper, I can say I helped build an app, but in reality, AI played a huge role. I just feel kind of like a fraud, even though I’ve been trying my best for my context, and I really do want to learn.\n\nAlso — I’m pretty sure she’s going to ask me to keep working during the school year to keep maintaining or expanding the app. Based on how things have gone so far, I’m not sure that’s a good idea. It feels like the workload will just keep growing, and since she doesn’t have experience in tech, it’s hard for her to gauge what’s realistic, and I'll just be stuck in this cycle of never learning things properly.\n\nWould love any advice, especially if you've been in a similar spot, on how I should approach future applications and internships and what to say for my interviews etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But here are two points that come to mind when you asked ur question:\n\n1. **Talk to your manager**: If AI is something that’s allowed at your company or it’s common practice, I’d definitely bring it up to her, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed and relying on it to get things done. You could mention that you’ve been using an internal AI tool to help a lot to help with coding, but you’re feeling like there’s still a gap in your knowledge you want to fill. If AI isn’t something your company uses, obviously don't say you've chatted a lot of it, but you could still bring it up when she assigns new tasks and just be upfront saying I'm not sure how to approach it, do you have any resources or someone in the company I could turn to if I have questions. \n2. **In interviews**: For future internships, don’t be hard on yourself for using AI, especially in today’s job market where AI is *everywhere* and it's *so difficult* to get an interview or job. Do not diminish the work you did by saying AI did a lot of it. And yeah, the only potential downside is if you’re asked to explain things in a more technical interview setting where you might need to go deeper. But honestly, just study, and you’ll be fine.",

Come into that conversation with full confidence given to you by the knowledge that a) you’re completely in the right and valid for feeling overwhelmed by this high level project as an intern and b) you’ll be completely okay if she says no and you go elsewhere. \n\nEither that or just begin searching for something else and leave. Just because she’s made the mistake of expecting an intern to code an entire app for the firm doesn’t mean you have responsibility to fix that assumption. \n\nAlso, frankly, if the AI is working for what you’re doing, you’re still understanding the code and debugging as you go, and you’re making sure to do lots of validation and verification testing to ensure no major problems or security flaws will ever be pushed to production… just keep using it.

I believe that helping people solve math problems will deepen my own understanding, and although I’m not tutoring discrete math (DM/DMS) which ties in closer to CS concepts, I think my experience will give me a rock-solid understanding of some of the concepts upon which DM is based on, which would help when I formally enroll in a DM class.\n\n2.

According to my boss and all my coworkers, I made an impressive impact while I was there, and I just loved the experience overall!\n\nBut as fall is coming around, I'm extra nervous about tech recruiting for next summer. I got my first internship through a lot of networking and a behavioral interview, nothing technical beyond the projects / experiences on my resume. I want to try aiming for Big Tech or a bigger company (though I wouldn't be opposed to interning at another startup either), and it feels like I'm facing a boss fight.\n\nHow do I know if my experience is \"enough\" for these roles compared to other candidates? I'm proud of what I did at the startup, but all my fellow CS majors have way more impressive sounding internship descriptions than me. Technical interviews sound extremely terrifying (like I have to code on the spot while someone watches me??). I also transferred into the CS major a bit late and I'm often insecure about being \"behind.\"\n\nI'm paranoid that my first internship was a fluke, and I'll never get an opportunity like that again. Are recruiters more likely to consider your resume if you've had a prior SWE internship on there? \n\nAny encouragement or advice would help a lot! Aside from just grinding LeetCode and maybe another personal project, I'm not really sure what to do. :((",

    "raw": "Feeling like a fluke in my cs internship\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m currently in a bit of a tough spot. I’m a CS major and wanted to get experience in software engineering, so I took an internship at a small finance company. The issue is, they don’t really have any tech people or mentors — they just handed me a project and told me to build a full web app (frontend and backend) from scratch. I don’t have much experience, so I’ve been relying a lot on AI to help me get through most of it.\n\nMy boss knew from the start that I only had very basic experience, but I don’t think she fully understands how difficult it is to actually build and launch a full MVP app — especially as a solo intern. She keeps throwing new feature ideas at me, expecting me to build both the frontend and backend, and it’s honestly overwhelming.\n\nI’ve been using AI to help me get through most of it — I understand the code and I do have to edit it and debug it a lot of times to work (so I do get the gist of things) and can explain what it’s doing, but I wouldn’t be able to write a lot of it from scratch without help. Because the expectation is to deliver a working product, I haven’t really had the time or space to sit down and actually learn things deeply — it’s all about output right now.\n\nI’m a rising sophomore, and I’m worried about how to talk about this experience when applying to future internships. On paper, I can say I helped build an app, but in reality, AI played a huge role. I just feel kind of like a fraud, even though I’ve been trying my best for my context, and I really do want to learn.\n\nAlso — I’m pretty sure she’s going to ask me to keep working during the school year to keep maintaining or expanding the app. Based on how things have gone so far, I’m not sure that’s a good idea. It feels like the workload will just keep growing, and since she doesn’t have experience in tech, it’s hard for her to gauge what’s realistic, and I'll just be stuck in this cycle of never learning things properly.\n\nWould love any advice, especially if you've been in a similar spot, on how I should approach future applications and internships and what to say for my interviews etc.\n\nThanks in advance!",

You could mention that you’ve been using an internal AI tool to help a lot to help with coding, but you’re feeling like there’s still a gap in your knowledge you want to fill. If AI isn’t something your company uses, obviously don't say you've chatted a lot of it, but you could still bring it up when she assigns new tasks and just be upfront saying I'm not sure how to approach it, do you have any resources or someone in the company I could turn to if I have questions. \n2. **In interviews**: For future internships, don’t be hard on yourself for using AI, especially in today’s job market where AI is *everywhere* and it's *so difficult* to get an interview or job. Do not diminish the work you did by saying AI did a lot of it. And yeah, the only potential downside is if you’re asked to explain things in a more technical interview setting where you might need to go deeper. But honestly, just study, and you’ll be fine.",

Come into that conversation with full confidence given to you by the knowledge that a) you’re completely in the right and valid for feeling overwhelmed by this high level project as an intern and b) you’ll be completely okay if she says no and you go elsewhere. \n\nEither that or just begin searching for something else and leave. Just because she’s made the mistake of expecting an intern to code an entire app for the firm doesn’t mean you have responsibility to fix that assumption. \n\nAlso, frankly, if the AI is working for what you’re doing, you’re still understanding the code and debugging as you go, and you’re making sure to do lots of validation and verification testing to ensure no major problems or security flaws will ever be pushed to production… just keep using it.

According to my boss and all my coworkers, I made an impressive impact while I was there, and I just loved the experience overall!\n\nBut as fall is coming around, I'm extra nervous about tech recruiting for next summer.

I also transferred into the CS major a bit late and I'm often insecure about being \"behind.\"\n\nI'm paranoid that my first internship was a fluke, and I'll never get an opportunity like that again.

    "raw": "Am I being unrealistic? L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?",

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad SDE Interview Experience (Outcome: Offer!!)\n\nHey everyone! Honestly can't even believe I'm writing with good news right now, I never in a million years thought this would happen to me. But this sub was really helpful to me while I was spiraling before receiving my offer, so hopefully I can help someone else by being transparent about my full process!\n\n# Timeline\n\nLate Februrary - Applied\n\nMid June - Received OA\n\nLate July - Received invitation to interview & availability survey (same day)\n\nAugust 4 - Loop\n\nAugust 7 - Offer\n\nAs you can see, the process was extremely slow and drawn out for me. I don't think this is typical, but I guess it can happen. When I received the OA, it was a total shock because I had assumed rejection after almost 4 months of silence. And then based on my performance in the OA, I assumed rejection again, so getting the interview was another huge shock :') But I've since learned that unless you specifically receive a rejection email, you're probably still in the running, no matter how long it's been. So have hope!\n\n# About Me & The Role\n\nI'm a May 2025 BSCS graduate from a slightly above-average private US university (not top tier but a handful of people land FAANG-level internships and jobs every year). I've had two previous internships, and both were at pretty mediocre companies. My GPA was good (graduated summa cum laude) and my projects were alright, but nothing amazing. I applied to the fungible SDE I New Grad position. So the way this position works is that you don't apply to a specific team or location. You just interview for a default SDE I position and if you pass the loop, they place you in a team afterwards. All I knew prior to my offer was that it was US-based, but no idea which specific location or team. If you'd like my exact job id, feel free to dm.\n\n# Online Assessment\n\nThe OA consisted of 2 DSA questions (I would say probably leetcode hard level), a work simulation, and a work style assessment. I did not do well on the coding part lol. I think I had TLE on a few test cases for the second problem, and I'm pretty sure my first problem's solution wasn't the cleanest either. I barely remember the questions and I obviously didn't get the optimal solutions so I can't tell you guys what concepts to study, sorry.\n\nHowever, I think the behavioral portion is weighted pretty heavily on this, considering I still got an interview despite that performance. At that point, I didn't know about Amazon's LPs, so I just answered everything honestly, and it worked out lol. But maybe brush up on the Leadership Principles if you want to prepare for the OA.\n\n# Final Loop\n\nI'm being purposely vague about the questions because I don't want to violate their policies. Please don't dm me asking exactly which questions I got. I don't think knowing that will help you much anyway, because the chances that you get the exact same ones I did are slim. Instead, I'll give you the broader concepts that they covered - make sure you practice a bunch of those types of problems, and you should be fine!\n\n**Round 1 (LP - probably bar raiser)**\n\nMy interviewer didn't have a technical background, which is why I assume he must have been the BR. The conversation was pretty casual; he told me at the start to try to respond in STAR format and use \"I\" statements rather than \"we\" - they're really looking for your specific contributions as an individual. Since I'm a recent grad, I drew most of my experiences from school projects, which I think is fine to do if you have limited industry experience. Be prepared for them to really dig into your answers. I got asked several follow-up questions for every story I told, so just make sure you actually know what you're talking about! He also often reiterated my own story to me to make sure he was representing me accurately, at which point I would either agree or elaborate with a few more points if I felt like he was missing any key details. At the end, we had time for me to ask him like 2 questions.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty decent about this round. I'm not sure how well I did at answering in STAR format because that's not something I've practiced a ton, but I tried to maintain a good balance of sharing enough details without getting way too granular (especially since my interviewer didn't know about the tech side of things). The interviewer was very nice but didn't give any clear indications as to how he thought I did.\n\n**Round 2 (LLD + DSA)**\n\nThis interviewer seemed much more serious than the first guy; we barely exchanged any pleasantries before we went straight into the coding problems.\n\nThe LLD problem I got was not as open-ended as \"design a parking lot\" - he gave me specific operations that the system had to accomplish, so there wasn't a ton of need for me to narrow the scope. It wasn't a problem I've seen before, but I guess kind of similar to the task management system or ATM. Again, smaller scope though. I think he was mainly looking for me to know what the appropriate data structures are to use, and to use them in a way that the code is extensible. I felt pretty good about my answer. I walked him through my thought process, implemented my initial design, then changed one data structure to another to optimize it. He asked me to explain the time and space complexity of each part of my code. I messed up here a little because I misremembered the time complexity of a certain operation on a data structure. (This was my biggest technical mistake throughout the whole loop. During the waiting game, I was feeling really bad about it - if you're in a similar situation, just remember that they don't expect you to be absolutely perfect, and everyone makes silly mistakes like that from time to time.) He asked a follow-up about how I would hypothetically extend my design to support another feature, which I explained but didn't code.\n\nThe DSA was like a leetcode medium graph traversal problem. I hadn't seen the exact problem before, but if you know one BFS/DFS problem, you kinda know them all. The approach was pretty clear, so I explained my thought process and then pretty much coded the whole thing out in one pass. He asked me to walk him through a test case, which I did, and then we ended the round with a few minutes of Q&A. I felt pretty good about this round overall too.\n\n**Round 3 (LP + DSA)**\n\nMy interviewer was an SDE II and not much older than me, so the conversation felt really relaxed. He only asked two behavioral questions and no follow-ups. I am currently working on a very interesting side project that I wanted them to know about, so I made sure to find a way to bring it up in this round since I couldn't in round 1 lol. He seemed very intrigued by it, so this round was off to a great start.\n\nThe DSA was another leetcode medium, this time a heap problem. It was very intuitive, so I explained my thought process and coded it out pretty quickly. He asked about optimizing a certain part of it, which I figured out could be done using a hash set. I did a dry run and explained the time and space complexity. We had a ton of time left, so he then asked me to write unit tests for it lol. After that, we still had like 20 minutes left, so we did a solid 5-10 minutes of Q&A/conversation, and then ended a little early. I think this round was probably my strongest - I got along super well with the interviewer and no hiccups at all!\n\n  \nAnd that was it! This is literally the only offer I got, but it only takes one! I was planning to go to grad school haha, I still can't believe that this is real life. I wish you all the best of luck with your interviews <3",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",

I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact.

As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it?

The interviewer then asked several LP questions and follow-ups. Again, I felt good about my performance.\n\nRound 3 (System Design): For this round, I was asked to design BookMyShow. I found that preparing from resources like HelloInterview was really helpful for this. The round concluded with more questions about the Leadership Principles.\n\nRound 4 (Bar Raiser): This was a comprehensive round. The interviewer started with Leadership Principles and then dug deep into my previous projects, asking a lot of behavioral questions. After that, we moved on to a Low-Level Design (LLD) problem: designing a car rental system. Specifically, I was asked to write code for the flow of a booked car being delivered to the customer.\n\nOverall, the process was thorough, and I felt well-prepared. Now, the waiting game begins!

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

They all went really well. I was happy and thought that with positive feedback I would be able to land the job.\n\nMy recruiter then called me with the feedback and said she would look for a team for me, which already felt strange because I had applied for a specific position. That role was already filled, so I was basically placed into a pool of applicants who passed the interviews (which had never happened to me before—usually you apply for one position and either get considered or not).\n\nLong story short, after 9 months no team was found for me in either location. Preparing for those interviews required a lot of effort and sacrifice in my personal life. Then, two months ago, a new recruiter took over my case, but the same thing happened again: he said he would try to find a team. After one month, he told me I would probably need to re-interview this winter after a one-year freeze.\n\nHonestly, I don’t know if I want to go through all the interviews again.

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

It’s nonsense\n\nI feel like it isn’t really about how many questions you do, but how much you understand them.\n\nThe last 2 weeks I did nothing but DFS. I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first. Identify “oh, I should use a min heap for this” and once you have that, things start to fall into place",

Back in April, a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, and after a few days of preparation, I had my first phone screen in May. That went well, and I received positive feedback, with the recruiter encouraging me to prepare for further rounds.\n\nHowever, a few days later I was told the role was on hold until at least July. Naturally, I was disappointed and stopped preparing actively.\n\nThis month, a new recruiter re-connected with me for an opportunity on the Google Cloud team. He scheduled an intro call with a tech lead, but unfortunately, the call got rescheduled multiple times as the tech lead couldn’t join. Eventually, the recruiter asked if I’d be open to proceeding with the four standard interviews (3 DSA + 1 Googliness) before that intro call, which I agreed to.\n\nHere’s how I felt the interviews went:\n\nRound 1 (DSA – Trees): Didn’t go well.\n\nRound 2 (DSA – Strings): Okay overall, but I made some assumptions the interviewer wanted differently.\n\nRound 3 (Googliness): I think it went fine.\n\nRound 4 (DSA – Strings): This round went well.\n\n\nIt’s been about 10 days since I completed the process. I’ve reached out to the recruiter for feedback but haven’t heard back yet.

Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

After less than 2 weeks of this I had too many recruiter calls/initial interviews scheduled that I stopped applying to new positions. \n\nOf all the recruiter calls I only failed to make it past one where it turned out from the salary \"range\" listed for the role they were only paying the absolute bottom so the job was not a good match for me anyways. Some companies started with a online assessment but I found these to be quite rare when applying for senior positions. \n\nOf all the companies that I proceeded to initial interviews with I was invited to take a final on site round with 3. Of these 3 I received offers from 2 and the other one told me my results were good but the position got filled already.\n\nResult:  \nGot 2 offers. One was fully remote but a bit of a low ball. 150k all cash, no equity or bonus, but fully remote. Declined this offer.\n\nSecond offer was with a late stage startup. 375k CAD TC (of which about 200 is cash), 2x per week in office. Basically a better offer than I imagined was even possible in Toronto. Accepted this offer and will be starting next month.\n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone may have!\n\n",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE 1 New Grad -US Interview ( Stressed out about the final verdict)\n\nI recently completed my Amazon SDE-1 New Grad (US) interview process, on July 24 and I have been very stressed out how the final outcome would be. I’d really appreciate your suggestions or feedback on my experience.\n\nRound 1 : (Bar Raiser)\nIn the first round, I performed exceptionally well. I engaged with the interviewer throughout the conversation and provided lengthy, well-structured responses using the STAR format and standard interviewing techniques. The interviewer was genuinely intrigued by some of my projects and went deep into the details during follow-ups. I believe I did well in this round. I even asked a few impressive questions to the interviewer and expressed my enthusiasm for joining Amazon. I also mentioned how comfortable I felt throughout the interview process.\n\nRound 2: (LP+ LLD)\nIn the second round, I was asked to present a project and discuss its technical aspects. I presented my project well and answered the interviewer’s questions thoroughly. I felt confident in my abilities and believed I had done well in this round as well.\nSimilar to the previous rounds, my LPs performed exceptionally well. I even came up with unique stories for different projects, different from the I used in Round 1. The interviewers were impressed by the research-based projects and decisions I made in my past endeavors. One of the interviewers posed technical questions about my projects, and I responded with a well-structured STAR format. Overall, my LP was good.\n\nThen comes the LLD, which seems to be a very small task and not something I’ve seen anywhere before. I started by listing out all the requirements and key features, then came up with solutions. I designed my drafted version, explained what I had done, and then gave a modified and better version of my modules based on the frequently changing requirements. I feel like I’ve done what I’ve been asked, except the design isn’t in OOD format because the task wasn’t in that format. Then, the Shadow asked me to identify the bugs and mentioned that there’s an edge case missing in it. I debugged my code but couldn’t find that edge case. I had mixed feelings for this round for my LLD. However, I feel like I’ve been actively communicating and keeping track of the requirements while coding it.\n\nRound 3 (Technical):\nDirectly jumped into the DSA and gave me two modified Leetcode-style questions.\n\nQuestion 1: It’s a variant of the Top k frequent items in a list problem, but with various edge cases and string manipulations involved. I gave my brute force approach and explained why it’s not a good solution. Then, I presented the hash map-based approach with two possible solutions: sorting by values or using a heap. I analyzed the complexities of both approaches. I implemented a fully working code, and the interviewer gave a small follow-up. I fixed my code to that change. Overall, he seemed satisfied.\n\nQuestion 2: With only 25 minutes left, the interviewer asked me to explain the solution while coding. It was a challenging LC graph question. I quickly came up with a solution because it was a combination of graph traversal and backtracking. I explained the question and started coding while talking. My pseudocode was fully executable and easy to understand. He asked me to explain the solution using the test case, and I explained the code. I quickly ran through the test case and gave the solution. I accidentally made the question a bit harder while asking the interviewer about the requirements, and my solution worked for it. Overall, he seemed satisfied with my approach. However, I made a mistake when he asked about the complexity of my code. I wasn’t entirely sure about it. But what I said was right when I checked after the interview. He then asked some follow-up questions about my approach and other technical questions related to it, and I answered them well. I feel confident about my performance in this round.\n\nI’m so stressed out about my final verdict. Based on your experiences, how would you rate this interview? Am I having a chance?\n\nEDIT : I got rejection today. I’m totally devastated after this decision, even after doing my best and performing well. At this point, I don’t even understand what they’re even looking in a New Grad. Anyway, thanks for all your support and reaching out. Good luck with your Job hunt!!",

Did my interviews, 2 technical(solver the original and followups in both with optimal TCs) and googlyness rounds went pretty well and for 3rd technical question I believe the question was a bit easy and I solved it with correct time complexity but there was some miscommunication where the interviewer was interested in me solving the question in a specific way but I wanted to solve it another way (I clarified in the beginning with the interviewer that he is only going to ask a single question). And to be clear, his approach was indeed more logical, but both approaches would have worked.\n\nRecruiter came back telling me that its a matter of when and not if as he said the feedback is pretty good all around. At this point I suspected that something is missing and realised that I might have given the interview as an L3. When asked, the recruiter said that he can't disclose the leveling saying its against company policy to tell me what level I am being selected for. Luckily he went on vacations and provided me with a substitute, who was very transparent about the levelling and clarified that the loop was initially set at L3. Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4. Since then he got me team matched for an L4 role and just submitted my packet for hiring committee saying that he is pretty optimistic about my application. What do you this is going to happen? Yay or Nay?\n\n\nUpdate 22nd Aug: Its a Yay for L4",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

    "raw": "50 LeetCode Questions You must Practice Before Your Google Interview (August 2025 Edition)\n\nI tracked every Google interview question reported across LeetCode discussions, Blind, interview forums, and various sources for the past year. After analyzing 200+ recent Google interview experiences from 2024-2025, one pattern shocked me: these 50 specific problems cover 87% of what's actually being asked in Google coding interview questions.\n\nThis isn't speculation. These patterns emerge from real interview reports, with specific problems appearing week after week in Google technical interview questions. The data shows clear tiers based on frequency, some problems appear in 42% of phone screens, others exclusively in L5+ final rounds.\n\n# The Context\n\nThis analysis covers L3-L6 positions based on reported experiences from January 2024 through August 2025. Google's interview patterns shifted significantly after their recent hiring freeze ended. The bar hasn't lowered, it's become more predictable. Interviewers now pull from a tighter pool of problems, especially for initial screens.\n\n# The 50 Questions (Ranked by Actual Frequency)\n\n# Tier 1: The Absolute Must-Knows (Appear in 40%+ of interviews)\n\nThese ten problems dominate Google interview questions coding reports:\n\n1. **\\[200\\] Number of Islands** (BFS/DFS) - 47% frequency\n2. **\\[146\\] LRU Cache** (design) - 45% frequency\n3. **\\[42\\] Trapping Rain Water** (two-pointers/stack) - 43% frequency\n4. **\\[56\\] Merge Intervals** (sorting) - 42% frequency\n5. **\\[297\\] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree** (design) - 41% frequency\n6. **\\[139\\] Word Break** (DP) - 39% frequency\n7. **\\[133\\] Clone Graph** (graph/BFS-DFS) - 38% frequency\n8. **\\[208\\] Implement Trie** (design) - 37% frequency\n9. **\\[239\\] Sliding Window Maximum** (monotonic deque) - 36% frequency\n10. **\\[560\\] Subarray Sum Equals K** (prefix + hashmap) - 35% frequency\n\n# Tier 2: High Frequency (Weekly appearances in reports)\n\nThese show up in 20-35% of **Google coding interview questions**:\n\n1. **\\[23\\] Merge k Sorted Lists** (heap/merge)\n2. **\\[128\\] Longest Consecutive Sequence** (hashing)\n3. **\\[295\\] Find Median from Data Stream** (two heaps)\n4. **\\[380\\] Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)** (design)\n5. **\\[394\\] Decode String** (stack)\n6. **\\[269\\] Alien Dictionary** (topological sort)\n7. **\\[340\\] Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct** (sliding window)\n8. **\\[417\\] Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** (multi-source BFS/DFS)\n9. **\\[684\\] Redundant Connection** (union-find)\n10. **\\[494\\] Target Sum** (DP/subset sum)\n\n# Tier 3: The Differentiators (L5+ and final rounds - 10-20% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[4\\] Median of Two Sorted Arrays** (binary search on answer)\n2. **\\[10\\] Regular Expression Matching** (DP)\n3. **\\[218\\] The Skyline Problem** (sweep line/heap)\n4. **\\[224\\] Basic Calculator** (stack/parsing)\n5. **\\[282\\] Expression Add Operators** (backtracking)\n6. **\\[315\\] Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** (BIT/merge sort)\n7. **\\[332\\] Reconstruct Itinerary** (Eulerian path)\n8. **\\[460\\] LFU Cache** (design)\n9. **\\[685\\] Redundant Connection II** (union-find + directed)\n10. **\\[727\\] Minimum Window Subsequence** (DP/two-pass)\n\n# Tier 4: The Specialists (System design coding hybrids - 5-10% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[31\\] Next Permutation** (array manipulation)\n2. **\\[57\\] Insert Interval** (intervals)\n3. **\\[212\\] Word Search II** (Trie + DFS)\n4. **\\[240\\] Search a 2D Matrix II** (2-pointer grid)\n5. **\\[261\\] Graph Valid Tree** (union-find/BFS)\n6. **\\[271\\] Encode and Decode Strings** (design)\n7. **\\[310\\] Minimum Height Trees** (graph trimming)\n8. **\\[329\\] Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix** (DFS + memoization)\n9. **\\[336\\] Palindrome Pairs** (trie/hashing)\n10. **\\[354\\] Russian Doll Envelopes** (LIS variant)\n11. **\\[363\\] Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K** (prefix + TreeSet)\n12. **\\[378\\] Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix** (heap/binary search)\n13. **\\[399\\] Evaluate Division** (graph/union-find)\n14. **\\[406\\] Queue Reconstruction by Height** (greedy sorting)\n15. **\\[421\\] Maximum XOR of Two Numbers** (bit trie)\n16. **\\[425\\] Word Squares** (trie/backtracking)\n17. **\\[480\\] Sliding Window Median** (heaps/balanced BST)\n18. **\\[490\\] The Maze** (BFS/DFS variants)\n19. **\\[652\\] Find Duplicate Subtrees** (tree hashing)\n20. **\\[668\\] Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table** (binary search on answer)\n\n# Patterns We've Noticed\n\nAfter tracking hundreds of Google interview reports, clear patterns emerged:\n\n**Phone Screens (45 minutes):** 82% pull from Tiers 1-2. Expect one medium, possibly escalating to medium-hard. Islands (200) and LRU Cache (146) dominate here, they appeared in 47% and 45% of phone screens respectively\n\n**Onsite Round 1-2:** Mix of Tier 1-2 with occasional Tier 3. The focus stays on clean implementation. Sliding window problems (340, 239) spike here\n\n**Onsite Round 3-4:** Tier 3-4 problems emerge. This is where Skyline (218) or Expression operators (282) separate L4 from L5+ candidates\n\n**Time Management:** Our data shows successful candidates average 25 minutes for Tier 1-2 problems, 35 minutes for Tier 3-4. Nobody expects perfect solutions for the hardest ones, clean approach with solid complexity analysis matters more\n\n# What's Changed in 2025\n\nComparing 2024 to 2025 Google technical interview questions, three shifts stand out:\n\n1. **Graph problems surged 30%** Union-find specifically jumped from 8% to 14% frequency. Problems like Redundant Connection (684, 685) moved from rare to regular\n2. **Pure DP decreased** Classic DP like Edit Distance dropped 40% in frequency. Google now prefers DP hidden within other patterns (Word Break, Target Sum)\n3. **Design hybrids exploded** LRU/LFU Cache, Serialize trees, Encode/Decode strings, these coding+design problems now appear in 35% of interviews, up from 20% last year\n\n# How to Use This List Effectively\n\nBased on successful candidate patterns:\n\n**Week 1-2:** Master Tier 1. These ten problems aren't just frequent, they teach the core patterns for everything else. Do each one three times: brute force, optimized, then from memory\n\n**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2. Focus on pattern recognition. When you see \"k distinct elements,\" think sliding window. \"Find median of stream\" always means two heaps\n\n**Week 5-6:** Sample Tier 3-4 based on your target level. L3-L4? Touch them lightly. L5+? These differentiate you\n\n**Daily routine:** Our data shows successful candidates practiced 3-4 problems daily, spending 2 hours. Quality beats quantity, understanding why approaches work matters more than solution count\n\n# The Resource\n\nFor those interested, we maintain a live database at [LeetWho.com](http://LeetWho.com) where we track actual Google coding interview questions as they're reported. It shows which problems appear in which rounds, when they were last asked, and what approaches work best. Gets updated weekly with new interview reports. The patterns become really clear when you see the actual frequency data.\n\nThe database includes solution patterns, time complexities Google accepts, and common follow-ups for each problem. Seeing \"\\[200\\] Islands follow-up: count distinct islands\" appearing in 23% of cases helps you prepare for the actual interview flow.",

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

    "raw": "From TCS → EXL → ABC → Google as AI/ML Engineer | Tier 3 College, ML/AI Prep, DSA Prep, Career Growth\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my journey from starting out as a manual tester at TCS to becoming an AI/ML Engineer at Google, working on LLM implementation at scale. I hope this inspires anyone who feels stuck in their career or doubts their background.\n\n🎓 Background\n\n- College: Tier 3 (GNA University)\n- No IIT/NIT/Ivy League — just persistence, curiosity, and consistent effort.\n\n\n👣 Step 1: Breaking In (TCS → TCS Digital)\n\n- Started as a manual tester at TCS. Honestly, not the dream start.Instead of losing hope, I kept learning Python, DSA, Data Science, and ML during nights and weekends.\n- Cracked TCS Digital through self-prep. That gave me a boost in confidence to go deeper into DSA + ML/AI.\n\n\n👣 Step 2: Data Science Career Growth (EXL)\n\n- Prepared rigorously for ML, data science concepts, and DSA.\n- Landed a role at EXL as a Data Scientist.\n- Parallelly, I started exploring Generative AI: reading research papers, following YouTube tutorials, and experimenting with side projects.\n\n\n👣 Step 3: GenAI Exploration (Aditya Birla Capital)\n\n- Joined Aditya Birla Capital as Senior Data Scientist.\n- Worked on deep learning for customer behavioral analysis.\n- Started exploring RAG, agentic AI, LLM fine-tuning, and prompt engineering.\n- Launched the GenAI 75 Challenge on LinkedIn & YouTube — completed it, and it became a turning point for my visibility + learning.\n\n\n👣 Step 4: The Google Breakthrough\n\n- Got approached by a Google recruiter via LinkedIn.\n\n- Had just 1 month to prepare → I went all-in on:\n\n—— LeetCode (Google-tagged + coding patterns only)\n—— ML System Design\n—— GenAI/LLM topics closely related to my work\n\n- Interview Rounds (6 in total):\n—— Screening\n—— 2x DSA Rounds\n—— 1x ML Round\n—— 1x Googliness & Leadership\n—— Managerial Round\n\n⛳️ Finally… Got the offer from Google! 🚀\n\n\n🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- Don’t underestimate compounding small efforts. Nights & weekends matter.\n- Even from a Tier 3 college, if you stay consistent, opportunities will come.\n- DSA + ML depth + System Design is a powerful combo for big tech.\n- Share your learning journey publicly (LinkedIn, YouTube) — it accelerates your growth and opens doors.\n\n\n📌 Reach me out for Prep Resources and Guidance: \n\n🔗 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/simranjeet97\n\n💻 GitHub (Projects & Source Code): https://github.com/simranjeet97\n\n▶️ YouTube (ML, GenAI, RAG, Agentic AI Tutorials): https://youtube.com/@freebirdscrew2023?\n\n\nIf you’re someone stuck in a testing/support role or feel your college background is holding you back, don’t lose hope.

YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Amazon New Grad SDE Interview Experience (Outcome: Offer!!)\n\nHey everyone! Honestly can't even believe I'm writing with good news right now, I never in a million years thought this would happen to me. But this sub was really helpful to me while I was spiraling before receiving my offer, so hopefully I can help someone else by being transparent about my full process!\n\n# Timeline\n\nLate Februrary - Applied\n\nMid June - Received OA\n\nLate July - Received invitation to interview & availability survey (same day)\n\nAugust 4 - Loop\n\nAugust 7 - Offer\n\nAs you can see, the process was extremely slow and drawn out for me. I don't think this is typical, but I guess it can happen. When I received the OA, it was a total shock because I had assumed rejection after almost 4 months of silence. And then based on my performance in the OA, I assumed rejection again, so getting the interview was another huge shock :') But I've since learned that unless you specifically receive a rejection email, you're probably still in the running, no matter how long it's been. So have hope!\n\n# About Me & The Role\n\nI'm a May 2025 BSCS graduate from a slightly above-average private US university (not top tier but a handful of people land FAANG-level internships and jobs every year). I've had two previous internships, and both were at pretty mediocre companies. My GPA was good (graduated summa cum laude) and my projects were alright, but nothing amazing. I applied to the fungible SDE I New Grad position. So the way this position works is that you don't apply to a specific team or location. You just interview for a default SDE I position and if you pass the loop, they place you in a team afterwards. All I knew prior to my offer was that it was US-based, but no idea which specific location or team. If you'd like my exact job id, feel free to dm.\n\n# Online Assessment\n\nThe OA consisted of 2 DSA questions (I would say probably leetcode hard level), a work simulation, and a work style assessment. I did not do well on the coding part lol. I think I had TLE on a few test cases for the second problem, and I'm pretty sure my first problem's solution wasn't the cleanest either. I barely remember the questions and I obviously didn't get the optimal solutions so I can't tell you guys what concepts to study, sorry.\n\nHowever, I think the behavioral portion is weighted pretty heavily on this, considering I still got an interview despite that performance. At that point, I didn't know about Amazon's LPs, so I just answered everything honestly, and it worked out lol. But maybe brush up on the Leadership Principles if you want to prepare for the OA.\n\n# Final Loop\n\nI'm being purposely vague about the questions because I don't want to violate their policies. Please don't dm me asking exactly which questions I got. I don't think knowing that will help you much anyway, because the chances that you get the exact same ones I did are slim. Instead, I'll give you the broader concepts that they covered - make sure you practice a bunch of those types of problems, and you should be fine!\n\n**Round 1 (LP - probably bar raiser)**\n\nMy interviewer didn't have a technical background, which is why I assume he must have been the BR. The conversation was pretty casual; he told me at the start to try to respond in STAR format and use \"I\" statements rather than \"we\" - they're really looking for your specific contributions as an individual. Since I'm a recent grad, I drew most of my experiences from school projects, which I think is fine to do if you have limited industry experience. Be prepared for them to really dig into your answers. I got asked several follow-up questions for every story I told, so just make sure you actually know what you're talking about! He also often reiterated my own story to me to make sure he was representing me accurately, at which point I would either agree or elaborate with a few more points if I felt like he was missing any key details. At the end, we had time for me to ask him like 2 questions.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty decent about this round. I'm not sure how well I did at answering in STAR format because that's not something I've practiced a ton, but I tried to maintain a good balance of sharing enough details without getting way too granular (especially since my interviewer didn't know about the tech side of things). The interviewer was very nice but didn't give any clear indications as to how he thought I did.\n\n**Round 2 (LLD + DSA)**\n\nThis interviewer seemed much more serious than the first guy; we barely exchanged any pleasantries before we went straight into the coding problems.\n\nThe LLD problem I got was not as open-ended as \"design a parking lot\" - he gave me specific operations that the system had to accomplish, so there wasn't a ton of need for me to narrow the scope. It wasn't a problem I've seen before, but I guess kind of similar to the task management system or ATM. Again, smaller scope though. I think he was mainly looking for me to know what the appropriate data structures are to use, and to use them in a way that the code is extensible. I felt pretty good about my answer. I walked him through my thought process, implemented my initial design, then changed one data structure to another to optimize it. He asked me to explain the time and space complexity of each part of my code. I messed up here a little because I misremembered the time complexity of a certain operation on a data structure. (This was my biggest technical mistake throughout the whole loop. During the waiting game, I was feeling really bad about it - if you're in a similar situation, just remember that they don't expect you to be absolutely perfect, and everyone makes silly mistakes like that from time to time.) He asked a follow-up about how I would hypothetically extend my design to support another feature, which I explained but didn't code.\n\nThe DSA was like a leetcode medium graph traversal problem. I hadn't seen the exact problem before, but if you know one BFS/DFS problem, you kinda know them all. The approach was pretty clear, so I explained my thought process and then pretty much coded the whole thing out in one pass. He asked me to walk him through a test case, which I did, and then we ended the round with a few minutes of Q&A. I felt pretty good about this round overall too.\n\n**Round 3 (LP + DSA)**\n\nMy interviewer was an SDE II and not much older than me, so the conversation felt really relaxed. He only asked two behavioral questions and no follow-ups. I am currently working on a very interesting side project that I wanted them to know about, so I made sure to find a way to bring it up in this round since I couldn't in round 1 lol. He seemed very intrigued by it, so this round was off to a great start.\n\nThe DSA was another leetcode medium, this time a heap problem. It was very intuitive, so I explained my thought process and coded it out pretty quickly. He asked about optimizing a certain part of it, which I figured out could be done using a hash set. I did a dry run and explained the time and space complexity. We had a ton of time left, so he then asked me to write unit tests for it lol. After that, we still had like 20 minutes left, so we did a solid 5-10 minutes of Q&A/conversation, and then ended a little early. I think this round was probably my strongest - I got along super well with the interviewer and no hiccups at all!\n\n  \nAnd that was it! This is literally the only offer I got, but it only takes one! I was planning to go to grad school haha, I still can't believe that this is real life. I wish you all the best of luck with your interviews <3",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career.

    "raw": "Am I being unrealistic? L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?\n\n",

The two questions were focused on Amazon warehouse problems, so they were very practical and scenario-based.\n\nInterview Rounds\nRound 1: The interview began with a deep dive into Amazon's Leadership Principles. Be prepared with specific examples from your past projects. After that, we moved on to two coding problems.\n * Problem 1: Find the maximum number of meeting rooms required.\n * Problem 2: A variation of the classic House Robber dynamic programming problem with some follow-up questions.\nI was able to solve both problems and felt confident in my answers for the LPs. This round went well, and I was immediately moved to the next one.\n\nRound 2: This round also started with coding.\n * Problem 1: The Find the Celebrity problem.\n * Problem 2: The Sum of Distances in Tree problem.\nI solved both of these as well. The interviewer then asked several LP questions and follow-ups. Again, I felt good about my performance.\n\nRound 3 (System Design): For this round, I was asked to design BookMyShow. I found that preparing from resources like HelloInterview was really helpful for this. The round concluded with more questions about the Leadership Principles.\n\nRound 4 (Bar Raiser): This was a comprehensive round. The interviewer started with Leadership Principles and then dug deep into my previous projects, asking a lot of behavioral questions. After that, we moved on to a Low-Level Design (LLD) problem: designing a car rental system. Specifically, I was asked to write code for the flow of a booked car being delivered to the customer.\n\nOverall, the process was thorough, and I felt well-prepared. Now, the waiting game begins! I'll keep you all posted on the final outcome.\n\nUpdate: Got a call from the recruiter — they’ve confirmed the SDE2 offer. Currently discussing the compensation details.",

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first.

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

Did my interviews, 2 technical(solver the original and followups in both with optimal TCs) and googlyness rounds went pretty well and for 3rd technical question I believe the question was a bit easy and I solved it with correct time complexity but there was some miscommunication where the interviewer was interested in me solving the question in a specific way but I wanted to solve it another way (I clarified in the beginning with the interviewer that he is only going to ask a single question). And to be clear, his approach was indeed more logical, but both approaches would have worked.\n\nRecruiter came back telling me that its a matter of when and not if as he said the feedback is pretty good all around. At this point I suspected that something is missing and realised that I might have given the interview as an L3. When asked, the recruiter said that he can't disclose the leveling saying its against company policy to tell me what level I am being selected for. Luckily he went on vacations and provided me with a substitute, who was very transparent about the levelling and clarified that the loop was initially set at L3. Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4. Since then he got me team matched for an L4 role and just submitted my packet for hiring committee saying that he is pretty optimistic about my application. What do you this is going to happen?

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

In one, the interviewer didn’t want me to code but just explain the approach.\n\nI think my coding rounds went excellent, followed all meta expectations such as asking questions, communicating throughout and running multiple test cases etc.\n\nFor coding I’d suggest Stick to Meta tagged questions on Leetcode + Minhmer’s list. That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

Discussed complexities, implemented correctly (I think), pretty difficult follow up, talked about it a bit but with no time for coding - neither do I think I knew how to implement it lol :D.c) Technical III - idk how to classify but I did Polish Notation, took some hints, knew a bit that it was implemented with some stacks, stumbled pretty badly but came up with solution in a reasonable time. Optimized the code a bit and had time for a couple of questions.d) Googlyness - Interviewer was relaxed had some generic questions, he seem genuinely interested and not wanting to drop some bombshell of a question like \"Describe a conflict you had with a coworker or manager. How did you handle it?\". All discussion was hypothetical and I think I did decent.\n\nOverall decent performance I hope I make it since I lost my job a month ago and idk it's been pretty rough.\n\n  \nLater EDIT: Received the green flag in order to move to the team matching phase!

    "raw": "Meta Code Screen – Passed!\n\nJust passed my first ever \"serious\" technical code screen with Leetcode-style problems. (I'd passed \"practical\" code screens that mostly tested general Python ability, but I'd never passed one where the bar was this high.) I figured I would share my experience.\n\nFirst, let me say that I won't give away the questions, but they were both in the top 50 tagged questions on Leetcode, no special variants whatsoever. I think officially one was listed as \"medium\" and the other as \"hard\", but both were on the easier end of those categories, and the \"medium\" one in particular is really an easy if you know the solution. The medium involved an array and a greedy solution and the \"hard\" (again, debatable) involved BFS / DFS on a grid. Not too bad. \n\nWhat went well for me was that I was very clear in explaining my thought process *before* I started coding. I wrote a commented-out high-level outline in the editor, asked my interviewer if this sounded like a good plan, and they agreed. Also, and this is important, I made sure to ask about empty input or any special cases, which they really liked. After the first problem I was asked to walk through an example to check correctness and I did.   \n  \nThe second problem (the DFS / BFS one) proceeded similarly: I outlined the solution, got buy-in, then implemented. In this case I forgot to ask about empty input (I didn't think the grid could be empty) but they asked me at the end how to handle that. I also missed incrementing a variable at one point and they mentioned that I had \"missed something\", but I was quick to identify it and thanked them for pointing it out, which probably helped my case.\n\nOnce it was over they asked me if I had any questions for them and I asked them about their projects and if overall they were happy with the work at Meta, and we had a nice little chat around that for a few minutes. I left feeling good.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience! Hope it helps! Now I have to pass the onsite... ",

    "raw": "Amazon SDE Graduate role Interview\n\nAs the title suggests, I will be going over my finals round onsite interview for Amazon SDE Graduate.  \n\n\nFinal Interview Recap:\n\nRound 1 involved two coding problems: •\tThe first was reversing through a rectangular matrix. My first solution only took to account a square matrix, which I quickly rectified once the interviewer brought it up. The second was a game-style problem — you had to move one position at a time in a linear array, but a robot could only jump a maximum of two spaces. If it jumped more, the game was lost. These were both medium-level LeetCode problems, and I cleared them confidently.\n\nRound 2 was purely behavioural — Amazon’s Leadership Principles. Honestly, I smashed it. The interviewer seemed to really enjoy my answers. At the end, she even said, “I hope to see you soon,” which made me feel great.\n\nRound 3 was with a senior engineer, and it was rough. His demeanour threw me off a bit. The first half was more LP questions, but I didn’t want to repeat stories from the previous round, so I made up new ones on the spot — in hindsight, I should’ve just reused the stronger ones.\n\nThen came the coding challenge: implementing an LRU cache — where you remove the least recently used key-value pair when capacity is exceeded.\n\nAt one point, he asked about the limitations of using a dictionary for key-value storage. I started talking about thread locking, but he quickly corrected me, saying that Python is single-threaded and that this wasn’t a valid concern. He hinted at memory as the real issue — that’s when it finally clicked he was expecting a full LRU cache solution.\n\nI started coding it, explained my approach and covered both the time and space complexity — but unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could finish.\n\n⸻\n\nOUTCOME— Rejected \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLooking back, I really believe that the last round is what cost me the offer. I just wish I had prepared more LeetCode patterns and system design-style problems beforehand. Right now, I feel like I failed — but I also know this isn’t the end.\n\nIt’s all part of the process.

L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat.

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

(Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

It’s transparent of which questions are going to be asked via leetcode tagged. So it’s gameable.\n\nHowever, I’m interviewing for a company with no leetcode tagged, and they ask a hard question that’s dependant on your understanding of this one vague algorithm? It’s nonsense\n\nI feel like it isn’t really about how many questions you do, but how much you understand them.\n\nThe last 2 weeks I did nothing but DFS. I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first. Identify “oh, I should use a min heap for this” and once you have that, things start to fall into place",

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?\n\n  \nP.S. Sorry for the long post.",

If you feel shaky on SD, study all you can but be realistic about what you actually know. It might be you're an E4, and that's ok.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to say \"I don't know\" in an interview. It's ok not to know everything. But, that admission should be followed by some kind of reasoning process. For example, if you're asked what kind database you'll use but you don't know of a specific one that fits your needs, you could say, \"I'm not sure, but I know it needs to be write optimized, and probably NoSQL because the data isn't highly relational and we're going to deal with higher write frequency than read\"\n\nThis shows the interviewer that while you don't have the answer now, you have the criteria to find it.

After less than 2 weeks of this I had too many recruiter calls/initial interviews scheduled that I stopped applying to new positions. \n\nOf all the recruiter calls I only failed to make it past one where it turned out from the salary \"range\" listed for the role they were only paying the absolute bottom so the job was not a good match for me anyways. Some companies started with a online assessment but I found these to be quite rare when applying for senior positions. \n\nOf all the companies that I proceeded to initial interviews with I was invited to take a final on site round with 3. Of these 3 I received offers from 2 and the other one told me my results were good but the position got filled already.\n\nResult:  \nGot 2 offers. One was fully remote but a bit of a low ball. 150k all cash, no equity or bonus, but fully remote. Declined this offer.\n\nSecond offer was with a late stage startup. 375k CAD TC (of which about 200 is cash), 2x per week in office.

    "raw": "HC result L4. Yay or Nay?\n\nMade a mistake during initial Google application and applied at SWE-II position mistaking it for SDE-II. Did my interviews, 2 technical(solver the original and followups in both with optimal TCs) and googlyness rounds went pretty well and for 3rd technical question I believe the question was a bit easy and I solved it with correct time complexity but there was some miscommunication where the interviewer was interested in me solving the question in a specific way but I wanted to solve it another way (I clarified in the beginning with the interviewer that he is only going to ask a single question). And to be clear, his approach was indeed more logical, but both approaches would have worked.\n\nRecruiter came back telling me that its a matter of when and not if as he said the feedback is pretty good all around. At this point I suspected that something is missing and realised that I might have given the interview as an L3. When asked, the recruiter said that he can't disclose the leveling saying its against company policy to tell me what level I am being selected for. Luckily he went on vacations and provided me with a substitute, who was very transparent about the levelling and clarified that the loop was initially set at L3. Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4. Since then he got me team matched for an L4 role and just submitted my packet for hiring committee saying that he is pretty optimistic about my application. What do you this is going to happen? Yay or Nay?\n\n\nUpdate 22nd Aug: Its a Yay for L4",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

At the end of the day you’re still graded on how you think as well, but a candidate given an easier problem will have a much easier time explaining their intuition and is more likely to pass.",

Although I’m devastated for not crossing the finish line at Meta, I wanted to share my experience here in hopes it helps someone else.\n\nSpecial mention to u/CodingWithMinmer, your variant list is an absolute goldmine and formed the backbone of my prep plus hellointerview premium helped me a lot, their system design pattern is brilliantly crafted and balanced for each level. \n\nCoding\n\nScreening:\n\t•\tLC 680 - Valid Palindrome II\n\t•\tLC 863 - All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree\n\nLoop (can’t share specifics due to NDA):\n\t•\t4 problems in total → 2x Medium (tree + graph) + 2x Hard\n\t•\tI solved everything and completed test cases. In one, the interviewer didn’t want me to code but just explain the approach.\n\nI think my coding rounds went excellent, followed all meta expectations such as asking questions, communicating throughout and running multiple test cases etc.\n\nFor coding I’d suggest Stick to Meta tagged questions on Leetcode + Minhmer’s list. That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

First Interview - preliminary discussion, got in touch with my recruiter, talked about my previous experience and some clasic behavioral questions.\n2. Phone Screen - LC medium, modified Dijkstra. Did well and answer the follow ups pretty much correctly.\n3. a) Technical I - LC medium I'd say, variation of Topological Sorting, coded correctly (I think), implemented 1 follow up, stumbled a bit upon the second but got it with no time to code (I don't think the recruiter would've wanted coding since it was quite a large but simple change).b) Technical II - LC medium again, Implement a Data Structure that's best for specific operations. Discussed complexities, implemented correctly (I think), pretty difficult follow up, talked about it a bit but with no time for coding - neither do I think I knew how to implement it lol :D.c) Technical III - idk how to classify but I did Polish Notation, took some hints, knew a bit that it was implemented with some stacks, stumbled pretty badly but came up with solution in a reasonable time. Optimized the code a bit and had time for a couple of questions.d) Googlyness - Interviewer was relaxed had some generic questions, he seem genuinely interested and not wanting to drop some bombshell of a question like \"Describe a conflict you had with a coworker or manager. How did you handle it?\". All discussion was hypothetical and I think I did decent.\n\nOverall decent performance I hope I make it since I lost my job a month ago and idk it's been pretty rough.\n\n  \nLater EDIT: Received the green flag in order to move to the team matching phase! Will come with updates from the TM. Goes to show you don't have to nail every problem. I actually asked a lot for hints.

As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat.

Be prepared with specific examples from your past projects. After that, we moved on to two coding problems.\n * Problem 1: Find the maximum number of meeting rooms required.\n * Problem 2: A variation of the classic House Robber dynamic programming problem with some follow-up questions.\nI was able to solve both problems and felt confident in my answers for the LPs. This round went well, and I was immediately moved to the next one.\n\nRound 2: This round also started with coding.\n * Problem 1: The Find the Celebrity problem.\n * Problem 2: The Sum of Distances in Tree problem.\nI solved both of these as well. The interviewer then asked several LP questions and follow-ups. Again, I felt good about my performance.\n\nRound 3 (System Design): For this round, I was asked to design BookMyShow. I found that preparing from resources like HelloInterview was really helpful for this. The round concluded with more questions about the Leadership Principles.\n\nRound 4 (Bar Raiser): This was a comprehensive round. The interviewer started with Leadership Principles and then dug deep into my previous projects, asking a lot of behavioral questions. After that, we moved on to a Low-Level Design (LLD) problem: designing a car rental system.

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",
    "summary": "Here's a breakdown of the interview experience info from the Reddit post and comments:\n\n* **Focus on Understanding, Not Just Memorization:**  \n    *  It's not enough to just memorize solutions.

It’s nonsense\n\nI feel like it isn’t really about how many questions you do, but how much you understand them.\n\nThe last 2 weeks I did nothing but DFS. I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first. Identify “oh, I should use a min heap for this” and once you have that, things start to fall into place",

(USA role)\n\nContext: Started working as a SWE at a big bank after graduation, but kept sporadically applying to new grad roles because I feel like my current role was limiting (aging tech) and I wanted more growth even at the cost of risk.\n\nApplied: Mid-May of 2025.\n\nOA: Took it early-mid June.\n\nA three interview loop was scheduled and taken this Monday.\n\nInterview 1: Probably bar raiser. 3 LP questions, each with a deep dive. This round I felt 50/50 on; I think my first answer came off as too esoteric and not very clear because I wanted to discuss a highly technical project I finished in school but perhaps some of it went over the interviewers head due to lacking communication on my end. Rest of the stories I answered with experiences building projects at my internship, and I felt like I smashed those pretty well. Though results speak otherwise...\n\nInterview 2: Two LPs, and an LC medium with followup. LPs were pretty easy, I focused on previous work experience again which I felt worked better than my school stories. LC I solved with some but not too many hints in optimal time, got the followup in optimal time as well. Probably smoothest round.\n\nInterview 3: 2 LCs. First one was a very common interview question that Amazon asks, solved it optimally and got good feedback from interviewer. I lowkey dropped the ball on the 2nd LC, wasn't actually that hard. It was a tree Q, thinking back should have been a slam-dunk but waffled because I wasn't exactly sure what the problem at hand was and the interviewer had explained it in a way that was not very intuitive (understandable to not give away answer). Eeked out an optimal solution with explanation of time complexity. Looking back, I probably missed a positive data point because I wasn't able to move onto a 3rd LC.\n\nVerdict: Rejected today, 4 business days later.

Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do?\n\n  \nP.S. Sorry for the long post.",

Down level is very normal but just know what you’re getting in.

Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4.

I started my leetcode journey at the beginning of summer, I felt like I would easily get burnt out if I was spending hours studying, so I just consistently do about 20-30 minutes a day, just do one problem a day. I have been following [algomap.io](http://algomap.io) cus I like the way they visualize the answer before coding, I totally feel like a beginner still, I’ve managed to get a couple easy questions done by myself, but majority of the medium questions I could not get the answer at all after 20 minutes. In terms of schooling, I am in my last semester, so I still have time to develop my skills before rushing to get a job. But the reason I asked this question is because I recently got the invitation to do the first round OA for Capitol One. If I am being honest, I know I’m not going to do well based off how I’m doing in LC. I am still going to take it for the experience, but I’m in this constant negative loop where I don’t feel ready to take these OAs, but I need to apply to jobs, I do need a job, I don’t want to wait till I graduate to start applying. That’s why I wanted to ask how do yall get through the initial months of not feeling ready at all? I’ve been trying to slowly increase the amount of studying I need to do, I’ve been slowly started liking LC, but I have a lot of moments where if I am totally lost, I just lose all motivation to even try.

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",

They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

At the end of the day you’re still graded on how you think as well, but a candidate given an easier problem will have a much easier time explaining their intuition and is more likely to pass.",

That covers everything.\n\n\nSystem Design\n\nPrepared with HelloInterview, System Design Interview by Alex Xu Vol. 1. YouTube videos and ChatGPT for understanding some concepts more thoroughly. \n\nMy system design round was a somewhat complicated one. The interviewer interrupted me multiple times in the beginning itself: when I tried to explain my initial approach with some trade-offs, like the one on hello interview (if you’re familiar with their pattern) discussing “bad” solutions before I make my final pitch for “great” solution. But he said I’m stuck at one part for sometime move to next, then he did that again for the next design component as well, basically he wanted me to move straight to finalizing design without discussing several approaches. That broke my flow and I froze for a few seconds.\n\nEventually I asked if he wanted me to focus on a specific aspect, and he said, “No, I want the entire design.” I tried to complete it and answered follow-ups (why this DB, why cache, why multiple nodes, etc.), but deep inside I felt I had already lost the round. This was different from my practice and mock sessions where interviewer didn’t interrupt me during design phase and only few times during deep dives and generally at the end the interviewer will discuss multiple deep dive approaches and tradeoffs. \n\nBehavioral\n\nThis was honestly the hardest for me and probably what cost me the offer.\n\t•\tThe interviewer asked 8 to 9 questions back-to-back, no introduction or “tell me about yourself.”\n\t•\tFor each, he wanted very deep dives into my answers, here again i practiced to keep story to the point and I had been told by recruiter + mock interviews to keep STAR answers 2 to 3 minutes.\n\t•\tI answered truthfully with stories from my startup + tier-2 company experience since my most and majority of my experience and background in automation and test infrastructure I think I couldn’t make strong impression with my stories but I could sense it wasn’t what he expected at an E5 level.\n\nAfter my interview I informed my recruiter about my openness for E4 but after the decision she said it’s not possible. She didn’t give me exact feedback but she said your coding was strong but hopefully next time you’ll have better stories to tell. \n\nReflections\n\nI wish I had practiced more system design mocks and more in-depth behavioral answers. The coding prep strategy worked (Meta tagged + variant list).\n\nI’ve never prepped this hard and learned so much in such a short time. Only thing hurts me is I’ve been trying from longtime to make a leap from test and automation driven development to fully backend development for large scale systems and I was closer than I could ever get but couldn’t cross the line. Now again I’m jobless with no interview lineup. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice on how I can do better, you’re most welcome.\n\nThough I didn’t make it this time, I hope this post helps the next person aiming for Meta.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Meta Code Screen – Passed!\n\nJust passed my first ever \"serious\" technical code screen with Leetcode-style problems. (I'd passed \"practical\" code screens that mostly tested general Python ability, but I'd never passed one where the bar was this high.) I figured I would share my experience.\n\nFirst, let me say that I won't give away the questions, but they were both in the top 50 tagged questions on Leetcode, no special variants whatsoever. I think officially one was listed as \"medium\" and the other as \"hard\", but both were on the easier end of those categories, and the \"medium\" one in particular is really an easy if you know the solution. The medium involved an array and a greedy solution and the \"hard\" (again, debatable) involved BFS / DFS on a grid. Not too bad. \n\nWhat went well for me was that I was very clear in explaining my thought process *before* I started coding. I wrote a commented-out high-level outline in the editor, asked my interviewer if this sounded like a good plan, and they agreed. Also, and this is important, I made sure to ask about empty input or any special cases, which they really liked. After the first problem I was asked to walk through an example to check correctness and I did.   \n  \nThe second problem (the DFS / BFS one) proceeded similarly: I outlined the solution, got buy-in, then implemented. In this case I forgot to ask about empty input (I didn't think the grid could be empty) but they asked me at the end how to handle that. I also missed incrementing a variable at one point and they mentioned that I had \"missed something\", but I was quick to identify it and thanked them for pointing it out, which probably helped my case.\n\nOnce it was over they asked me if I had any questions for them and I asked them about their projects and if overall they were happy with the work at Meta, and we had a nice little chat around that for a few minutes. I left feeling good.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience! Hope it helps! Now I have to pass the onsite... ",

I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first.

Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

Man, these problems are hard. \n\nI started my prep around 10 days ago. It takes me 1.5-3 hours to solve a medium/hard problem. How the hell am I supposed to solve something like Minimum Window Substring in an interview in under 10 min unless I have solved it before? Is that really true? You can't really solve an unknown problem in interview, unless you have solved it before?\n\nI am grinding 10 hours every day (while managing work) but am only able to solve like 4-5 problems each day. With each problem, I am writing down feedback what I did good and what I didn't, referring to it and before I solve the next problem and so on. I know its such a short time to conclude on things since I started my prep just 10 days ago. Nevertheless, I am continuing the grind, I believe there's light at the end of tunnel, so we'll see.\n\nI am wondering if someone felt the same and if you can share your experience how you got better at leetcode.",

Maybe a few problems, maybe a few days or a week, or until you get bored. Just dont think you need to completely master a topic before moving on to the next one. You can always go back and practice more of something later. For the first few problems in a topic, just looking up a solution, understanding it, and retyping it might be a better use of your time than just going in blind and hoping you can reinvent the wheel.\n\nWhen solving problems you might see something that seems new or like a trick. Try to identify what the trick or aha moment was and writing those down somewhere. This is helpful mostly as a reflection exercise rather than as something you would actively reference, but I suppose you could refer to it when solving problems.",

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3. These are the resources and approaches I've personally used and recommend, I'm sure there are other good ones I am unaware of.\n4.

    "raw": "50 LeetCode Questions You must Practice Before Your Google Interview (August 2025 Edition)\n\nI tracked every Google interview question reported across LeetCode discussions, Blind, interview forums, and various sources for the past year. After analyzing 200+ recent Google interview experiences from 2024-2025, one pattern shocked me: these 50 specific problems cover 87% of what's actually being asked in Google coding interview questions.\n\nThis isn't speculation. These patterns emerge from real interview reports, with specific problems appearing week after week in Google technical interview questions. The data shows clear tiers based on frequency, some problems appear in 42% of phone screens, others exclusively in L5+ final rounds.\n\n# The Context\n\nThis analysis covers L3-L6 positions based on reported experiences from January 2024 through August 2025. Google's interview patterns shifted significantly after their recent hiring freeze ended. The bar hasn't lowered, it's become more predictable. Interviewers now pull from a tighter pool of problems, especially for initial screens.\n\n# The 50 Questions (Ranked by Actual Frequency)\n\n# Tier 1: The Absolute Must-Knows (Appear in 40%+ of interviews)\n\nThese ten problems dominate Google interview questions coding reports:\n\n1. **\\[200\\] Number of Islands** (BFS/DFS) - 47% frequency\n2. **\\[146\\] LRU Cache** (design) - 45% frequency\n3. **\\[42\\] Trapping Rain Water** (two-pointers/stack) - 43% frequency\n4. **\\[56\\] Merge Intervals** (sorting) - 42% frequency\n5. **\\[297\\] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree** (design) - 41% frequency\n6. **\\[139\\] Word Break** (DP) - 39% frequency\n7. **\\[133\\] Clone Graph** (graph/BFS-DFS) - 38% frequency\n8. **\\[208\\] Implement Trie** (design) - 37% frequency\n9. **\\[239\\] Sliding Window Maximum** (monotonic deque) - 36% frequency\n10. **\\[560\\] Subarray Sum Equals K** (prefix + hashmap) - 35% frequency\n\n# Tier 2: High Frequency (Weekly appearances in reports)\n\nThese show up in 20-35% of **Google coding interview questions**:\n\n1. **\\[23\\] Merge k Sorted Lists** (heap/merge)\n2. **\\[128\\] Longest Consecutive Sequence** (hashing)\n3. **\\[295\\] Find Median from Data Stream** (two heaps)\n4. **\\[380\\] Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)** (design)\n5. **\\[394\\] Decode String** (stack)\n6. **\\[269\\] Alien Dictionary** (topological sort)\n7. **\\[340\\] Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct** (sliding window)\n8. **\\[417\\] Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** (multi-source BFS/DFS)\n9. **\\[684\\] Redundant Connection** (union-find)\n10. **\\[494\\] Target Sum** (DP/subset sum)\n\n# Tier 3: The Differentiators (L5+ and final rounds - 10-20% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[4\\] Median of Two Sorted Arrays** (binary search on answer)\n2. **\\[10\\] Regular Expression Matching** (DP)\n3. **\\[218\\] The Skyline Problem** (sweep line/heap)\n4. **\\[224\\] Basic Calculator** (stack/parsing)\n5. **\\[282\\] Expression Add Operators** (backtracking)\n6. **\\[315\\] Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** (BIT/merge sort)\n7. **\\[332\\] Reconstruct Itinerary** (Eulerian path)\n8. **\\[460\\] LFU Cache** (design)\n9. **\\[685\\] Redundant Connection II** (union-find + directed)\n10. **\\[727\\] Minimum Window Subsequence** (DP/two-pass)\n\n# Tier 4: The Specialists (System design coding hybrids - 5-10% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[31\\] Next Permutation** (array manipulation)\n2. **\\[57\\] Insert Interval** (intervals)\n3. **\\[212\\] Word Search II** (Trie + DFS)\n4. **\\[240\\] Search a 2D Matrix II** (2-pointer grid)\n5. **\\[261\\] Graph Valid Tree** (union-find/BFS)\n6. **\\[271\\] Encode and Decode Strings** (design)\n7. **\\[310\\] Minimum Height Trees** (graph trimming)\n8. **\\[329\\] Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix** (DFS + memoization)\n9. **\\[336\\] Palindrome Pairs** (trie/hashing)\n10. **\\[354\\] Russian Doll Envelopes** (LIS variant)\n11. **\\[363\\] Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K** (prefix + TreeSet)\n12. **\\[378\\] Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix** (heap/binary search)\n13. **\\[399\\] Evaluate Division** (graph/union-find)\n14. **\\[406\\] Queue Reconstruction by Height** (greedy sorting)\n15. **\\[421\\] Maximum XOR of Two Numbers** (bit trie)\n16. **\\[425\\] Word Squares** (trie/backtracking)\n17. **\\[480\\] Sliding Window Median** (heaps/balanced BST)\n18. **\\[490\\] The Maze** (BFS/DFS variants)\n19. **\\[652\\] Find Duplicate Subtrees** (tree hashing)\n20. **\\[668\\] Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table** (binary search on answer)\n\n# Patterns We've Noticed\n\nAfter tracking hundreds of Google interview reports, clear patterns emerged:\n\n**Phone Screens (45 minutes):** 82% pull from Tiers 1-2. Expect one medium, possibly escalating to medium-hard. Islands (200) and LRU Cache (146) dominate here, they appeared in 47% and 45% of phone screens respectively\n\n**Onsite Round 1-2:** Mix of Tier 1-2 with occasional Tier 3. The focus stays on clean implementation. Sliding window problems (340, 239) spike here\n\n**Onsite Round 3-4:** Tier 3-4 problems emerge. This is where Skyline (218) or Expression operators (282) separate L4 from L5+ candidates\n\n**Time Management:** Our data shows successful candidates average 25 minutes for Tier 1-2 problems, 35 minutes for Tier 3-4. Nobody expects perfect solutions for the hardest ones, clean approach with solid complexity analysis matters more\n\n# What's Changed in 2025\n\nComparing 2024 to 2025 Google technical interview questions, three shifts stand out:\n\n1. **Graph problems surged 30%** Union-find specifically jumped from 8% to 14% frequency. Problems like Redundant Connection (684, 685) moved from rare to regular\n2. **Pure DP decreased** Classic DP like Edit Distance dropped 40% in frequency. Google now prefers DP hidden within other patterns (Word Break, Target Sum)\n3. **Design hybrids exploded** LRU/LFU Cache, Serialize trees, Encode/Decode strings, these coding+design problems now appear in 35% of interviews, up from 20% last year\n\n# How to Use This List Effectively\n\nBased on successful candidate patterns:\n\n**Week 1-2:** Master Tier 1. These ten problems aren't just frequent, they teach the core patterns for everything else. Do each one three times: brute force, optimized, then from memory\n\n**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2. Focus on pattern recognition. When you see \"k distinct elements,\" think sliding window. \"Find median of stream\" always means two heaps\n\n**Week 5-6:** Sample Tier 3-4 based on your target level. L3-L4? Touch them lightly. L5+? These differentiate you\n\n**Daily routine:** Our data shows successful candidates practiced 3-4 problems daily, spending 2 hours. Quality beats quantity, understanding why approaches work matters more than solution count\n\n# The Resource\n\nFor those interested, we maintain a live database at [LeetWho.com](http://LeetWho.com) where we track actual Google coding interview questions as they're reported. It shows which problems appear in which rounds, when they were last asked, and what approaches work best. Gets updated weekly with new interview reports. The patterns become really clear when you see the actual frequency data.\n\nThe database includes solution patterns, time complexities Google accepts, and common follow-ups for each problem. Seeing \"\\[200\\] Islands follow-up: count distinct islands\" appearing in 23% of cases helps you prepare for the actual interview flow.",

Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

    "raw": "People working at Google (US): Does the actual day to day work justifies the competency demanded in the interviews?\n\nI was going to ask this question in a comment but then, i thought, this way, I’ll get more reach. \nI have seen people sharing their google interview experiences, some of which lasted approximately 6-8 months, that too sometimes ends in a rejection. It just made me wonder, the questions for L4 and above are no joke and requires serious preparation. The follow up question really grills the candidate and evaluates their depth of understanding. That’s quite high merit tbh. So, what i keep thinking about, is that whether it’s fun working at Google and whether the daily task keeps people on their toes, particularly for backend and distributed systems engineers?",
    "summary": "- **Company:** Google\n- **Role:** Backend and distributed systems engineers (L4 and above)\n- **Rounds:** Not specified, but implies multiple rounds based on the comment about 6-8 month interview processes.\n- **Questions:**\n    - Focus on data structures and algorithms (LeetCode-style)\n    - Deep understanding of concepts is evaluated through follow-up questions.\n- **Difficulty:**\n    - Interview questions are considered very difficult, requiring significant preparation.\n    - Day-to-day work is challenging but not as time-pressured as interviews.\n- **Tips:**\n    -  Being able to explain your thought process clearly is important.\n    -  Demonstrate strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals.\n    -  The work environment is highly competitive, so you need to be able to keep up with your colleagues. \n\n\n",

I think it’s worth knowing most people answering will not have joined within the last 2 years, which means there is a high probability their interviews were significantly easier when they joined.\n\nI personally feel the bar is just set arbitrarily, the questions you can ask are based on an internal database and the main reason people ask insanely hard questions is to try to gatekeep the position, anyone who has worked at any of the FAANG companies knows asking a hard DP problem and expecting them to complete it within 45 minutes isn’t going to tell you anything about someone besides whether they’ve seen the problem before. At the end of the day you’re still graded on how you think as well, but a candidate given an easier problem will have a much easier time explaining their intuition and is more likely to pass.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Stop trying to make recruiters think, or why your resume is bad and how to fix it\n\nI'm one of the authors of *Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview* and the founder of [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io). About a month ago, I posted about how the [whole resume writing industry is snake oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1lt8eia/the_whole_resume_writing_industry_is_snake_oil/). People seemed to like that post, so here's a practical followup. After all, it's easy to say that resume writing isn't a good use of time and that you should focus your efforts on outreach, but at the end of the day, I know that no matter what I say, people will still grind on their resumes. So, look, if you’re going to do something to your resume, let’s make sure that that something is low-effort and high-return. Unlike the endless resume tweaking that most candidates do, these changes directly address how recruiters actually read resumes.\n\nThe most important bit? **Don't make recruiters think. Your resume should serve up the most important things about you on a platter that they can digest in 30 seconds or less.**\n\n**1. Stop putting filler buzzwords in your \"About\" section. Use it to spell out the most impressive things about you.**\n\nYour \"About\" or \"Summary\" section is prime real estate. Yet so many candidates fill this section with meaningless jargon like \"passionate self-starter\" or \"detail-oriented team player.\" Instead, use this section to explicitly tell recruiters the 2-3 most impressive things about you in plain English. This is your chance to control the narrative. *Want recruiters to take something away from reading your resume?* Don’t assume they’ll figure it out. They’re not reading it long enough to intuit anything. Spell it out for them verbatim in this section. Do this, not that:\n\n❌ Results-driven full-stack engineer with a passion for scalable systems and user-centric design  \n✅ Senior engineer with 3 years at Amazon, promoted twice in 3 years (2X the company average)\n\n**2. Don’t include your GPA if it’s under 3.8**\n\nThis is simple but effective: only include your GPA if it's 3.8 or higher. A middling GPA doesn't help your case and might inadvertently signal academic mediocrity. If your GPA isn't stellar, focus on other academic achievements: hackathons, technical competitions, fellowships or scholarships. These provide better signals about your capabilities than a so-so GPA.\n\n**3. Context matters for lesser-known companies**\n\nIf you've worked at Google or Facebook, recruiters instantly get what kind of company you're coming from. But when you have \"TechStartup123\" on your resume, they have no idea what they're looking at or how impressive it might be. For lesser-known companies, include a one-line description explaining what the company does, along with any impressive metrics or investors:\n\n❌ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc.\"  \n✅ \"Software Engineer, DevTools Inc. ($50M Series B from Sequoia, 2M+ active users)\"\n\nThis simple addition provides crucial context that helps recruiters evaluate your experience properly. Without it, they might discount valuable experience simply because they don't recognize the company name.\n\n**4. Avoid the \"job-hopper\" misperception**\n\nHere's a common mistake: listing each role at the same company as if they were separate jobs. This can make recruiters think you've job-hopped, which is often seen as a red flag. Instead, group different roles under the same company heading:\n\n❌ Listing separate entries for \"Junior Developer at XYZ\" and \"Senior Developer at XYZ\"  \n✅ \"XYZ Company - Senior Developer (2021-Present) - Junior Developer (2019-2021) Promoted in 2 years vs. company average of 3.5 years\"\n\nThe second format clearly shows growth within a single company and explicitly highlights faster-than-average promotion, which is a strong positive signal. (You may also want to carry over your promotion cadence into your “About” section, as you saw above.)\n\n**5. Be crystal clear about your work authorization status (for US positions)**\n\nThis one is particularly crucial if you're applying for jobs in the US, but you have a foreign-sounding name and/or education outside the US. I've seen many qualified candidates get passed over because recruiters assumed they needed visa sponsorship when they actually didn't. Don't leave this to chance.\n\nMake your work status explicit in your header or summary section:\n\n❌ No mention of work authorization (leaving recruiters to guess)  \n✅ \"US Citizen\" or \"Green Card Holder\" or \"Authorized to work in the US without visa sponsorship\"\n\n**6. Career changers: provide context about the change**\n\nIf you've switched careers, your resume can look confusing without proper context. Recruiters might struggle to understand why someone with your background is applying for this role, or they might not recognize how your previous experience translates to your current trajectory.\n\nAddress this head-on in your “About” section.\n\n❌ Listing previous career experience with no explanation of your transition  \n✅ \"Transitioned from marketing to software engineering in 2021 after completing a bootcamp\" or \"Former accountant who pivoted to data science through self-study and online courses while continuing full-time work\"\n\nThis context helps recruiters understand your timeline and puts your current title and achievements in perspective. Without it, you risk serious misinterpretation. Recruiters might think you're far more junior than you actually are in your new field (potentially ruling you out for appropriate-level positions)\n\nOr conversely, they might assume you have years of relevant experience in your new field (and then wonder why you haven't achieved more in that time)\n\nBoth misinterpretations can be fatal to your application. By providing a clear timeline of your transition, you help recruiters accurately gauge your experience level and set appropriate expectations. This transparency also demonstrates valuable traits like adaptability and determination.\n\nAnd here's another key point for career changers: you don't need to list all your previous positions before the transition... unless they're impressive. Be selective about what pre-transition experience you include:\n\n❌ DON'T include mundane or irrelevant details from your previous career that add nothing to your current narrative. Your three years as a retail associate before becoming a developer probably won't strengthen your software engineering application.  \n✅ DO highlight prestigious achievements from your previous career. If you were, say, a concert pianist, a lawyer who graduated from a top-tier law school, or a management consultant at McKinsey, absolutely include that. These signal that you're smart and high-achieving, regardless of domain.\n\nHere's a TL;DR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gstkjombpvgf1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f38fa7d855892af2fbdda7ebb3e4a8395a1fbd2",

First Interview - preliminary discussion, got in touch with my recruiter, talked about my previous experience and some clasic behavioral questions.\n2. Phone Screen - LC medium, modified Dijkstra. Did well and answer the follow ups pretty much correctly.\n3. a) Technical I - LC medium I'd say, variation of Topological Sorting, coded correctly (I think), implemented 1 follow up, stumbled a bit upon the second but got it with no time to code (I don't think the recruiter would've wanted coding since it was quite a large but simple change).b) Technical II - LC medium again, Implement a Data Structure that's best for specific operations. Discussed complexities, implemented correctly (I think), pretty difficult follow up, talked about it a bit but with no time for coding - neither do I think I knew how to implement it lol :D.c) Technical III - idk how to classify but I did Polish Notation, took some hints, knew a bit that it was implemented with some stacks, stumbled pretty badly but came up with solution in a reasonable time. Optimized the code a bit and had time for a couple of questions.d) Googlyness - Interviewer was relaxed had some generic questions, he seem genuinely interested and not wanting to drop some bombshell of a question like \"Describe a conflict you had with a coworker or manager. How did you handle it?\". All discussion was hypothetical and I think I did decent.\n\nOverall decent performance I hope I make it since I lost my job a month ago and idk it's been pretty rough.\n\n  \nLater EDIT: Received the green flag in order to move to the team matching phase! Will come with updates from the TM. Goes to show you don't have to nail every problem. I actually asked a lot for hints.

L5 at G struggling to get Staff (L6) interviews.\n\nHey everyone, I'm hoping for a reality check and some advice on my current job search.\n\nI'm an L5 SWE at Google with 14 years of total experience (3.5 at G, 9 at a well-known NYC FinTech before that). I feel I've been performing at an L6 level for a while, leading cross-team projects with org-level impact. In a previous role, a project I designed and built became the foundation for an entirely new sister team.\n\nDespite this, my job search over the last 3-4 weeks has been a rude awakening. I'm getting plenty of interest from recruiters, but only for Senior (L5 equivalent) roles. As soon as I push for a Staff role, I either get ghosted or receive an automated rejection—even from companies that aren't well-known.\n\nI used an AI tool to review my resume and realized it was heavily focused on my accomplishments as a Senior SWE, not a potential Staff SWE. I've updated my LinkedIn and resume to focus more on impact, influence, and technical leadership.\n\nI'm wondering if others are in the same boat. How do you handle this situation where your experience says L6 but your title says L5, and recruiters can't see past it? What was the \"aha!\" moment that helped you break through and land those Staff interviews?\n\n",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting. He still took time to answer my question thoughtfully, and the total round lasted around 62–63 minutes.\n\n**How do you think it went?**  \nI’m honestly quite anxious. Did I mess this up? Should I keep applying elsewhere or hold out hope for this one?\n\nP.S - Used GPT to refine the post.\n\nEdit - This was for USA\n\n  \nUpdate: Got a reject!",

    "raw": "Interview Journey with Glean, Uber, etc For L5/Senior Roles\n\nHey, I am a Software Engineer based out of India with 5 YoE. I was helped immensely by a few of the online communities for my interview prep, so here’s something from my side to give back. I’ll briefly introduce myself, then go over two sections: the prep and the interviews (with their offer numbers, if offered). Gear up for a long (and hopefully helpful) post.\n\nSo a quick intro: I am a CS grad from a Tier-1 Indian college. I had been working at Google for around the past 3 years. I was an L4 and there were a few reasons I decided to leave (in no particular order):\n\n- Lack of good projects to get a promo. This was partly my fault and partly because there were too many L4s in my team.\n- My comp for 2025 was actually lower than 2024 due to front loaded stocks at the time of joining.\n- I was nearing 5 YoE which is good enough to get an L5 (or equivalent role) in most companies, so I decided I’ll leave Google if I get an L5 position at a company of my choice rather than waiting a year or so for the L5 promo at Google itself.\n\nCurrent TC:\n\n- Base: 41L\n- Yearly bonus: 8L\n- Stocks (to be vested in 2025): 30-35L (depending on where the stock is)\n- Total: 80-85L\n\n# The Prep\n\nI prepared for a total of 2-3 months with an average of 2-3 hours of daily studies/practice. According to my experience, there were a total of 4 kinds of rounds that companies ask (with some exceptions like Stripe). I’ll go over each one of them in the order of the time I invested for them.\n\n## System Design\n\nI spent the most amount of time on System Design prep. Partly because I thought for an L5, this should be the most important round and also because working at Google comes with the disadvantage that you’re cut off from the key technologies so much that you’ve to learn about them from scratch (although there are a lot of similar things in Google but there are quite a few differences too) and also because there’s so much to learn too. \n\nI will list down the resources I studied from and roughly in which order, but keep in mind that everyone will have a different requirement and might need more basic learning first or could skip some of the basic stuff too.\n\n1. Designing Data-Intensive Application Book: This is a classic textbook that I’d say one should read even if they’re not preparing for interviews, but especially if they are. It goes into the details of how databases work internally among other things. This is a great book for building fundamentals of the System Design.\n2. System Design Interview (Vol 1) by Alex Xu: This is a very beginner friendly book and explains terms like consistent hashing, CAP theorem, etc while solving some of the easier System design problems.\n3. Hello Interview website: This I’d say is the most important resource among all. Mainly because of the practice section in it. The practice sections have a bunch of questions (each with a solution written for it and most have videos too of solutions), where each question is split into multiple sub-questions that you’ve to answer one-by-one on which you get AI generated feedback. You’ve to buy a premium for this practice section, but I think it’s totally worth it. They also have reading material on the website which is quite helpful and is free.\n4. System Design Interview (Vol 2) by Alex Xu: In contrast to the first volume of the book, this goes into a lot of details of every problem, maybe sometimes more than what’d be needed for an interview and could be overwhelming, so only come to this when you’ve a good understanding of things. I only read a few chapters from this book. \n5. Some other resources that I considered and went through partly are:\n    1. ‘Jordan has no life’ channel’s Youtube playlists.\n    2. Some of Gaurav Sen’s YouTube videos.\n\nA few extra pointers that I’d like to give are:\n\n- Take good notes that you can go through again and again.\n- List down every topic that you want to prepare for (like reading SQL vs NoSQL, internals of Redis, etc) and make sure you check them all.\n- Follow a pattern/path during interviews. I followed the one that HelloInterview suggests: Listing function and non-functional requirements first, then core entities and rough API contract too. Then proceed to a HLD design with a basic structure handling all function requirements and then proceed to identify bottlenecks (non-functional reqs helps here) and solve them.\n\n## DSA\n\nThis I’d say most people are familiar with on how to prepare for. My plan was to solve top company tagged questions for the companies I was preparing for (this requires premium though). With this, there’s a good chance that you will get a few DSA questions in your interviews that you’ve already solved. \n\nMake sure you’ve gone through all the main topics too, like DP, graphs, two pointers, stack, binary search, etc.\n\n## LLD/Machine Coding\n\nI would say there’s a lack of very good resources for preparing for LLD rounds even though they are becoming increasingly important with time (as focus on DSA reduces). I’d break down the types of questions asked in LLD in 2 categories:\n\n1. Focused on implementation heavy DSA questions. These are questions like implement LRU cache, LC 432, etc.\n2. Focused on design principles. Learn design principles like SOLID, Strategy, Observer, Factory, Singleton, etc. Although I feel Big Tech (and good startups) don’t focus much on this, I could be wrong.\n\nThe focus of this round is to give working code quickly, and most optimal algorithm might not be needed always. There’s also emphasis on having good class structure with SOLID principles, code modularity, good variable naming, etc.\n\nOne resource I found helpful was awesome-low-level-design repo on github by ashishps1 which has solutions for a few famous problems in multiple languages. Christopher Okhravi's Design patterns playlist on YT is also good to learn design patterns (especially the first 6 videos).\n\nChoosing a language here is very important, as most people are familiar in Java OOPS but in C++ STL. For DSA, C++ STL is enough and OOPS is not needed, but LLD rounds require both. I chose Java because C++ requires memory management (there’s smart pointers but I didn’t want to get into that) so I had to learn Java equivalents for C++ STL and practice for it.\n\nWhile speed is important for every round, it is the most critical for these LLD rounds as companies want candidates who can give working code quickly.\n\n## Hiring Manager/Past Work\n\nThere are mainly two kinds areas of discussion here:\n\n- Your past work experience where the interviewer who is mostly the hiring manager goes into the details of your past projects (1 or 2). Make sure you choose a few projects (maybe just one project if it’s enough) that showcases your technical prowess in which you had to take some design decisions weighing the alternatives, maybe had junior engineers working with you (if you’re going for a Senior role) and worked with different stakeholders.\n    - To prepare for this, I did a mock round from Hello Interview (it’s expensive but the interviewer was very helpful and gave a few good pointers). Mock interviews are helpful in general, but more so for this round is what I feel.\n    - Make sure you have a diagram handy of the project you’re going to discuss here, maybe on Lucidchart.\n- General behavioral questions that I don’t think I need to go in detail here.\n\n# The Interviews\n\nA few pointers here before I proceed on my interview experiences:\n\n- List out the companies who want to go for and categorize them into “dream” and “target”. Once you’ve done some basic level of prep, you can start applying to the “target” companies while maybe tailoring your prep slightly to the company for which you’ve upcoming interviews (as sometimes these companies have slightly different procedures). It’s okay to be rejected from these companies, but important to gain experience and confidence from these rounds before starting to apply for “dream” companies.\n- Try to have competing offers in hand which can easily help you negotiate your salary by 10-20%. It’s a very important bargaining chip.\n\nI had the following list of dream companies:\n\n- Uber\n- Glean (an enterprise search software company)\n- Databricks\n- Stripe\n\nDatabricks generally needs more YoE for a Senior role and Stripe has a very unconventional interview procedure (debugging and API integrations rounds), so I thought of applying to Uber and Glean first and then going for the Databricks and Stripe if I don’t get into any one of the first two.\n\nAnd to practice I chose following companies:\n\n- Coinbase\n- Linkedin\n\n## Coinbase (IC5)\n\nI applied through their portal here. Their turnaround time was very quick and interviews were also scheduled very quickly.\n\n**OA round:** They had a DSA/implementation heavy round for OA. Clean code was not needed, only passing their tests was. Make sure you’re very quick with using sets, maps, etc. \n\nI passed the OA round and next up, three rounds were scheduled for main interview.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked to design a stockbroker for crypto. Went well I think but there were a few hiccups when I said I’d use Redis sorted sets to solve for something.\n\n**Tech Execution:** This was an LLD round only that I honestly fumbled because I wasn’t quick enough because of my lack of speed in using Java collections. Otherwise the round was not tough, just needed very quick implementations for the many parts there were to the problem.\n\n**Domain:** Again an LLD round which I was more prepared for after messing up the previous one and I think I did really well in this one.\n\n**Verdict:** Ghosted which I can assume meant No hire. In retrospect, I applied for this without any LLD prep (and then didn’t prepare much either for it). But it was okay as I didn’t want to go to Coinbase anyway and it was a good learning experience.\n\n## Linkedin (IC3)\n\nI applied via Linkedin only for this and again their turnaround time was very quick.\n\n**Screening round:** There was a LC medium and some CS basics questions. Went very well.\n\nI passed the screening round and then there were 4 rounds scheduled:\n\n**DSA 1 & 2:** Couple of LC medium questions in both. Were simple enough (and I actually had seen 1-2 of them on LC while practicing) and both rounds went well.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a slight modification of the famous ‘top-K articles/videos shared’ question. This round didn’t go very well partly because I wasn’t well prepared. The interviewer was also not very receptive to my points at times.\n\n**Past work/HM:** Mainly the round was focused on past complex projects I had worked on, of my choosing. Interviewer asked a few questions here and there on my choices. This round went quite well.\n\nRecruiter reached out to me saying that they want to take a repeat of System design round as it didn’t go well, but in office. I agreed, but stalled for 2-3 weeks because my Glean and Uber rounds had started, and also because I wanted some competing offer for Glean/Uber.\n\n**System Design Part 2:** Interviewer wanted to discuss my team’s overall architecture for first half which went quite well and second half was for a quick system design question which went well I’d say.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. \n\n**TC:** Initially they had said they can give a max of 95L-1Cr for a Senior role, but by this time I already had the Glean offer so they were willing to go up to 1.15 Cr but I declined. This TC includes all the components (base they were offering was 65L).\n\n## Glean (Lead/Senior role)\n\nThis was the main company I was preparing for, mostly because of the future share value potential and amazing talent density. I was lucky that the recruiter only reached out to me at the right time. I only replied when I was confident with my prep though.\n\n**HM round:** A brief 30 mins round for intros and about what I’ve worked on in the past. Don’t think this was supposed to be a hire/no-hire decision round.\n\nThere were a total of 4 rounds after that:\n\n**DSA 1&2:** Both rounds had LC medium-hard questions with a hard followup. There was a good discussion in both and interviewers were quite receptive of my ideas. In one of the rounds, my solution was optimal but would have led to a lengthy implementation so there the interviewer suggested a slightly different approach which I hoped on quickly. Both the rounds went quite well but I felt they could’ve been slightly better due to different reasons.\n\n**Past Work:** I was well prepared for this with diagrams handy to explain quickly. Round was supposed to last for 60 mins but interviewer was happy with me and the round ended in 45 mins with last 5-10 mins going into ‘Why leave Google’ kind of questions.\n\n**LLD round:** This was a 120 min round that I was honestly a little nervous about because I didn’t know what to expect, but it was a typical implementation round just with more parts to it. I wrote good modular code with SOLID principles (especially the S part of it). Any other design principles were not needed but I needed to be quick and was able to complete all the parts. I did later notice after the round that in the last sub-part I had not handled one case (because I had not read the question properly), but not sure if the interviewer noticed that.\n\n**Verdict:** Hire. They did not let me negotiate as I didn’t have any competing offers at the time (Linkedin was there but they were giving lesser comp so that didn’t matter), and also because they strongly felt that the comp they were offering was quite good. \n\n**TC:** 65 base and 5000 RSUs (not ESOPs) to be vested equally in 4 years. Their share value according to the last funding round is around 50$, so that means around 55L per year, bringing total comp to around 1.2 Cr (they don’t have any bonuses).\n\n## Uber (L5)\n\nRecruiter had reached out to me. I replied back when I was confident with my prep.\n\n**Screening:** A DSA question of LC medium difficulty that I was able to answer quickly and then some discussion happened about my past work.\n\nI passed the screening and there were 4 rounds scheduled after that:\n\n**DSA:** I didn’t find the interviewer very good for this round. The first two questions he gave me were known to me which I told him (not sure why XD, as I’ve not done that in the past). He gave a different question after that which he maybe wasn’t prepared for as there were a lot of edge cases in it (especially in the followup) and I guess the question was new to him too. I solved the main part quickly but didn’t get a lot of time for the followup’s edge cases but I did give some hand-wavy solution. A lot of time was wasted in this round in the beginning in changing the questions and interviewer had a meeting after that so he didn’t extend the interview.\n\n**LLD:** Interview asked me a LC medium DSA question only for this which I was able to solve quickly and we had some chat about my past work after that.\n\n**System Design:** I was asked a Ad click aggregator similar question. Interview went above average, not the best but I felt it was passable.\n\n**Past Work/HM:** This was a 90 mins round. First 50 mins went into a past project discussion which I felt went well but not sure if the interviewer felt the same. Next 40 mins went into behavioral questions which I felt went good but then at the end interviewer asked me why am I not waiting to become L5 at Google before looking for L5 opportunity elsewhere (which I felt was a stupid question because why not?), I said I feel I’m L5 ready but won’t become L5 for a year more in Google. We had a bunch of to and fro on that where I felt she was not very happy with some of my answers.\n\n**Verdict:** Recruiter told me that they want to take a repeat of the HM round, but as I had already gotten the Glean offer and that being my first preference I declined.\n\nSo yeah, joining Glean now! Feel free to ask questions and I’d love to answer as many as I can. But please don’t ask the specific questions that were asked in the interviews to me.",

Back in April, a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, and after a few days of preparation, I had my first phone screen in May. That went well, and I received positive feedback, with the recruiter encouraging me to prepare for further rounds.\n\nHowever, a few days later I was told the role was on hold until at least July. Naturally, I was disappointed and stopped preparing actively.\n\nThis month, a new recruiter re-connected with me for an opportunity on the Google Cloud team. He scheduled an intro call with a tech lead, but unfortunately, the call got rescheduled multiple times as the tech lead couldn’t join. Eventually, the recruiter asked if I’d be open to proceeding with the four standard interviews (3 DSA + 1 Googliness) before that intro call, which I agreed to.\n\nHere’s how I felt the interviews went:\n\nRound 1 (DSA – Trees): Didn’t go well.\n\nRound 2 (DSA – Strings): Okay overall, but I made some assumptions the interviewer wanted differently.\n\nRound 3 (Googliness): I think it went fine.\n\nRound 4 (DSA – Strings): This round went well.\n\n\nIt’s been about 10 days since I completed the process. I’ve reached out to the recruiter for feedback but haven’t heard back yet.

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

Luckily he went on vacations and provided me with a substitute, who was very transparent about the levelling and clarified that the loop was initially set at L3. Upon clearing up this confusion and explaining my background (4 years Amazon experience since graduation with last 2 years as SDE-2), the recruiter agreed that the loop should have been set at L4.

    "raw": "[Guide] Cleared Meta E5 + Other FAANG Interviews. My Process & Resources\n\nI cleared Meta (E5) and got the max offer with not even 6 yoe. I also passed onsites with Apple (ICT4), Palantir and a hedge fund. I think the interview pipeline is ~75% in your control once you get in the pipeline and I want to give back to the community with some resources and suggestions. \n(I have 6 yoe, 4 of them in big tech. US citizen. TC is 500k in HCOL)\n\nTLDR: Polish your LinkedIn and plan out your application schedule. Prepare with Neetcode 150, Hello Interview, and writing out behavioral answers. Then refine with mock interviews and targeted Leetcode practice until you're confident.\n\n  \n\n# Company Agnostic Tips\n\n###   Getting Your Foot in the Door: \n> This is the hardest part since there's alot of luck getting into the pipeline, so control what you can.\n\n#### 1. Brush Up on Your Resume\n> Your resume should be a highlight reel of your work not the complete edition. \n- Alot of \"resume advice\" is personal preference, here is what I believe is universal.\n- Use a standard, one column layout like [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) that is easy to parse for humans and bots. \n- Use metrics often to communicate the scope and impact of your work. \n- Make sure your formatting is consistent (period after each sentence, date formatting etc). \n- Don't be afraid to tailor your resume for your top companies.\n- The effectiveness of your resume is the product of ResumeFormatting * ResumeContent. No amount of formatting will make an unimpressive background impressive. It might be the best thing for your resume to grind a bigger project at work, take a post grad cert, or a competition etc.\n    \n#### 2. Linkedin\n> This is the top of your funnel so take this seriously. In my case, 3 of my 4 final rounds were sourced by random recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn. \n- Make your profile attractive: add skills, get endorsements, link your resume, have a quality profile picture etc.\n- Don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture, but do go into settings and set yourself as open to work to recruiters.\n- Respond to every DM from recruiters you get to show the LI algo you are active, if you dont have several companies you're in process with, you should be saying yes to all of them.\n\n    \n#### 3. Apply Generously\n> I've heard so many stories of people who say \"Google is my dream company\", apply to Google, fail, then become dejected. There's too much variance in the hiring process to only apply to your favorite company / companies. \n- Apply to \"C tier\" companies, those you wouldn't accept an offer even if you got one.\n- A few weeks later apply to \"B tier\" companies, those who you might consider leaving for if you get an offer.\n- A little later, apply to \"A tier\" companies, your dream jobs that you want the most.\n- Stacking this way you get lots of time, practice and motivation to improve your resume, talk to recruiters, practice interviews and hopefully, get some competing offers.\n- Alternatively to the 3 tier approach above, you can order companies based on their process time. Starting with longest process first, so they all end around the same time. Use [Interviewing.io's Planning Company Order Worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search) to help with this.\n    \n\n### Technical Interviews\n> Leetcode is like learning multiplication. Memorizing the times table gives you the building blocks to solve unseen and harder problems. No genius who has never seen multiplication could solve `3 * 3` since they don't know what the `*` symbol means.\n- Solve [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  Treat it as a textbook not a test. Try for 20 minutes and when/if you are stumped look at the answer and study it until you can reproduce it.\n- Memorize Neetcode 150. I made a flashcard for each one with the problem, summary, and input on one side, and a bullet point algo on the other side. Memorize these not in the hopes you'll be asked one but so you can learn patterns and have a starting point when seeing a similar problem.\n-  After learning Neetcode, test yourself by trying to solve through another list. Either [Strivers](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) , [Alphabet 150](https://alphabet150.com/), [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions-by-krishnade-9xev/) or [Minmer's List of Varients](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6615244/meta-variant-compilation-by-codingwithmi-0pm7/). You can optionally have chatgpt shuffle all problem names so you don't know the category.\n- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and  [Leetcode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/)\n- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it. \n- You can do \"offline mocks\" on [Leetcode Assessment](https://leetcode.com/assessment/) or [Interviewing.io 's AI Mock](https://start.interviewing.io/interview-ai)\n- Then mocks with people on [Pramp/Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/practice) (free but low caliber) or pay on sites like [I Got An Offer](https://igotanoffer.com/) (affordable but can be hit and miss) or [Interviewing.io](https://start.interviewing.io/dashboard/interviewee) (pricier but more consistent quality)\n\n**Tip**: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la [Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/appendix/bonus#interview-checklist-image). Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.\n    \n---\n###   Behavioral Interviews\n> \"I'm pretty good at behavioral interviews\" -Every engineer I've talked to. If you want to outperform them and land a role then you have to take behavioral prep seriously, not just wing it. Behavioral and System Design are the largest factors that determine your level.\n- Think through your past, by company then by project and craft stories for each. Or go through a list of common interview questions. Either way write out answers to each.\n- As you go, \"tag\" each part of your answer with the question topics it can address. (Was this a \"Challenging Project\"? Did you \"Exceed Expectations\"? Did you \"Balance Multiple Priorities\" etc.) The goal is to get several stories which can each be framed slightly differently so you are always are prepared with a rehearsed answer.\n- Use metrics here too not just in your resume. In the Results section of your STAR method have numbers here if appropriate. Communicate the scope and your seniority by mentioning how long projects took, how many teams you interacted with, or how much traffic flowed through.\n- Be prepared to explain your projects and impacts to technical and non technical people. You should be able to make each group care and be impressed by your work.\n- Have a few \"go to\" questions to ask at the end. My defaults are either \"You've been at the company for a long time how has it changed since you've been here\" or \"You recently joined, what caused you to pick this company\". Use this chance to try and build rapport and be memorable.\n- I found [Hello Interview's Behavioral Guide](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/how-to-prepare) helpful\n\n**Tip**: When asked a hypothetical \"how would you handle X\", it's best to answer from experience not as a hypothetical. \"I actually experienced that and I did Y\".\n\n---   \n### System Design Interviews\n> Active vs Passive: Don't be satisfied to just read books or watch videos, you need to draw and talk, you need to experience a curveball and backtrack.   \n> Breadth vs Depth: Lots of people will recommend reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) and watching [Jordan Has No Life](https://www.youtube.com/@jordanhasnolife5163). There is a place for these, but you should know your place. For 80% of people reading this, 80% of that content is overkill and will take away from your studies.\n- Read [Hello Interview's \"System Design In a Hurry\"](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)\n- Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)\n- Solve Easys and Mediums and after each question you solve, wait some time and read the solution guide to understand the tradeoffs and reasons they made their decisions.\n- Take notes of things you learned or any interesting patterns and a screenshot of their final design. This will let you build a list of the top 10-15 patterns that you can then adapt to whichever question you will be asked.\n\n**Tip**: System Design interviews are meant to test how you solve it, not if you can solve it. They will note the amount you are driving the conversation, the features you identify and choose to prioritize, and the tradeoffs you consider when making a decision.\n\n---\n### Offer Negotiation\n> Negotiation is not about saying the magic words, but having the magic numbers. \n- 80% of your leverage will come from competing offers so (much easier said than done) get as many as you can.\n- 15% comes from your interview performance and the rapport you built so (much easier said than done) do as well as you can.\n- 5% comes from other factors, such as any unvested equity you will be walking away from or an upcoming annual bonus.\n- There are different offer components you can try and negotiate: base amount, bonus amount, sign on bonus amount, starting date, deferred/restricted timelines, etc. Some are harder than others, but whatever you agree on, get it in writing.\n- If a recruiter says \"Best and Final\" they mean it, respect it.\n- Always be respectful, lots of engineers come across as entitled here.\n- I found lots of good tips from [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Cracking-Coding-Interview-Successfully/dp/195570600X) where they describe \"The Ladder\" of starting from your least favorite offer and negotiating up the list ending with your first choice.\n    \n\n# My Personal Interview Experience\n> Since some will ask how my interviews went\n\n### Prep\n* I did 300-400 leetcode questions. 10-15 system design question, wrote ~8 pages of behavioral answers and did ~30 mock interviews. With all this, after each onsite I felt confident and even a bit overprepared.\n* I wanted Google, but they didn't consider me for E5 or E4 roles, and I would later pass Meta E5. There's a lot of variance like this so don't take a rejection personally and don't put too much hope in one company.\n* I applied to ~30 companies, making it to 4 onsites, and passing each of them. Even with all my prep, that is a pretty steep fall off. It's a numbers game.\n  \n### Meta (E5)\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nPhone Screen:   \n2 questions in ~45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy-medium, the second was a medium-hard. I solved both optimally. I later saw one of them deep on the list of Meta top 3 month tagged.   \n\nOnsite:   \n2 technical rounds, 2 questions each, 40 mins. All were easy-medium questions and all from Meta's top 3 and 6 month tagged on Leetcode.    \nSystem design question was not on Hello Interview. But it was an easy-medium problem and I felt very prepared for it.    \nBehavioral round had standard \"technical behavioral\" questions. Was prepared for each.   \n\n### Apple (ICT4)\n\nSource: I was reached out to on Linkedin.\n\nNote: Apple is special because each team has their own hiring process. So it can be a very different experience per team. \n\nPhone Screen:\n2 questions in 45 minutes.    \nFirst was an easy, the second was a medium. I solved the second suboptimally but still passed.   \n\nOnsite:\n7 hours over 2 days.    \nA few standard technical rounds.    \nA few behavioral rounds, one with the eng team, one with the ML sister team, and one with product team. Most of these were with 2 people, almost like a panel.    \nOne system-design-like interview with no drawing just a verbal back and forth, this had a few constraints that made it non standard.\n\n### Palantir (SWE, not FDSE)\n\nSource: I cold applied online, no referral.\n\nPhone Screen:\nLeetcode Medium, very standard\n\nNote, palantir has a very unique final round, I found this guide to be very helpful: https://interviewing.io/palantir-interview-questions\n\nOnsite:   \n1 Leetcode medium, very standard.  \n1 System Design. This had a very interesting twist where I wasnt allowed to use a pattern I had taken for granted, I struggled to work around it but was happy with my solution.   \n1 Reengineering. This was a ~500 line project in Java that I needed to understand, find then fix several bugs at all levels of the stack.   \n\nHiring Manager Call:   \nThis started with a system-design-like verbal discussion and transitioned into coding the core data structure we landed on. It was not one I had not seen or used before. It was fair but unexpected. I struggled and at the end was nearly done, he said \"I'm confident you are on the right track and could finish it with a little more time\". The next day I was told I failed this round.\n\n\n---\n# Notes & Disclaimers\n1. I'm happy to answer questions in comments\n2. I am NOT affiliated with any sites or resources listed.\n3.

    "raw": "From layoff to offer — my 6-month journey through the tech job market\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cazdfhp2kthf1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2a156cb4250c38f1d3660d34e5610ddaea15f3\n\n**The Layoff**\n\nIn February 2025, I got laid off after nearly 8 years as a software engineer for this company. It was cold, quiet, and out of nowhere — “business decision”. No transition, no conversation, no cushion. Just done.\n\nI took a few days to process. Then, with no plan, I started cold applying. I didn’t have a strong network. No referrals. No direction. And despite all my experience, my confidence was shot. I didn’t believe in myself — and it showed.\n\n**The Grind**\n\nThe first few weeks were brutal. I’d get a few interviews but barely made it past the initial rounds. My resume wasn’t working. My mindset wasn’t working. I was throwing darts in the dark, and nothing stuck.\n\nI tweaked everything. Resume, targeting, approach — the works. I followed every “get hired in tech” thread I could find. Still, I went through a stretch of total silence. No callbacks, no emails, no rejections. Just nothing. The kind of nothing that makes you feel invisible.\n\nEventually, I started seeing traction again. Now I was reaching final rounds — but still getting rejected. One company ran me through 5 interviews over an entire month, then ghosted me after the final round. Two weeks later, I got a rejection email with exactly two words. That one hit hard.\n\nThen, **Amazon** sent me an **SDE II L5 OA** invite. I had never touched LeetCode before. I locked in, solved 100+ problems in under 2 weeks. I thought I was ready. But the OA humbled me — no, the OA destroyed me — and the rejection that followed felt like a door slammed in my face.\n\nThat week was rock bottom. I was exhausted, discouraged, and deeply unsure if I’d bounce back at all.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, I found some hope in two more hiring processes that showed early promise — great recruiter calls, positive technical screens, encouraging signals all around. But both ended in back-to-back rejections. In one, I stumbled through a shallow OA that barely tested anything relevant. Their rejection confirmed I was their top pick after the behavioural round, but they’d rather trust an irrelevant OA’s results over a full panel interview conducted by real humans from their organization. In the other, I was caught off guard by a deeply frontend-focused live coding round — for what was supposed to be a backend-heavy role. Each one pushed me further down the hole of hopelessness.\n\n**A New Hope**\n\n*And then… something changed.*\n\nA recruiter from a company I had cold applied to two months earlier reached out. The process that followed felt completely different. Everything was crisp — fast, fair, human. The recruiter was clear and communicative. The tech screen was collaborative and energizing. I actually enjoyed the interviews.\n\nFor the first time in months, I remember thinking: *“This has to be the one.”*\n\nI made it to the final round — three back-to-back interviews in a single day. I prepped hard. I stayed calm. I showed up with focus. It went better than I expected.\n\n**The Offer**\n\n**A few days later, I got the call:**  \n“We had multiple engineering managers interested in hiring you. The team was really impressed.”\n\nI had applied for an L3 role. They offered me L4.\n\nThen came the verbal offer — and I just sat there in shock. Joy. Relief. Gratitude. Disbelief. The moment hit like a wave. After everything, I had done it.\n\nA few days later, the written offer landed — strong base, bonus, equity — and I finally felt like I could breathe again.\n\nWhile all of this was happening, I made it through another final round at a different company and received a second offer. But I chose the first one — because it felt right from the very first conversation.\n\n**What Helped**\n\n* DSA: Leetcode Premium + company-tagged problems\n* System Design: HelloInterview + *JordanHasNoLife* (YouTube — highly underrated)\n* Behavioral: 10–12 refined STAR stories, multiple resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews with my partner\n\n**Where I Landed**\n\nI’m now starting as a Senior Software Development Engineer (L4) at a FAANG-adjacent company operating at global scale — the kind of place where performance, real-time systems, and high-stakes decisions all collide.\n\nThe total compensation is north of $200K CAD, and the scope is easily the most exciting I’ve seen in my career.\n\n**Final Words**\n\nIf you’re in the middle of it — stuck in the void, doubting your value, watching opportunities disappear — please hear this:\n\n>You’re not behind. You’re just not there yet.  \nYour “Yes” will come by eventually,  \nYou just haven’t read the subject line yet.",
    "summary": "-  **Company/Role:** FAANG-adjacent company, Senior Software Development Engineer (L4)\n- **Rounds:** OA, technical screens, behavioral rounds, final round with multiple back-to-back interviews\n- **Difficulty:** OA was challenging, technical screens were collaborative and energizing, final round was demanding\n- **Tips:**\n    -  LeetCode for DSA\n    -  HelloInterview and JordanHasNoLife (YouTube) for system design\n    -  Prepare 10-12 refined STAR stories, practice resume walkthroughs, and mock interviews \n\n\n\n",

    "raw": "50 LeetCode Questions You must Practice Before Your Google Interview (August 2025 Edition)\n\nI tracked every Google interview question reported across LeetCode discussions, Blind, interview forums, and various sources for the past year. After analyzing 200+ recent Google interview experiences from 2024-2025, one pattern shocked me: these 50 specific problems cover 87% of what's actually being asked in Google coding interview questions.\n\nThis isn't speculation. These patterns emerge from real interview reports, with specific problems appearing week after week in Google technical interview questions. The data shows clear tiers based on frequency, some problems appear in 42% of phone screens, others exclusively in L5+ final rounds.\n\n# The Context\n\nThis analysis covers L3-L6 positions based on reported experiences from January 2024 through August 2025. Google's interview patterns shifted significantly after their recent hiring freeze ended. The bar hasn't lowered, it's become more predictable. Interviewers now pull from a tighter pool of problems, especially for initial screens.\n\n# The 50 Questions (Ranked by Actual Frequency)\n\n# Tier 1: The Absolute Must-Knows (Appear in 40%+ of interviews)\n\nThese ten problems dominate Google interview questions coding reports:\n\n1. **\\[200\\] Number of Islands** (BFS/DFS) - 47% frequency\n2. **\\[146\\] LRU Cache** (design) - 45% frequency\n3. **\\[42\\] Trapping Rain Water** (two-pointers/stack) - 43% frequency\n4. **\\[56\\] Merge Intervals** (sorting) - 42% frequency\n5. **\\[297\\] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree** (design) - 41% frequency\n6. **\\[139\\] Word Break** (DP) - 39% frequency\n7. **\\[133\\] Clone Graph** (graph/BFS-DFS) - 38% frequency\n8. **\\[208\\] Implement Trie** (design) - 37% frequency\n9. **\\[239\\] Sliding Window Maximum** (monotonic deque) - 36% frequency\n10. **\\[560\\] Subarray Sum Equals K** (prefix + hashmap) - 35% frequency\n\n# Tier 2: High Frequency (Weekly appearances in reports)\n\nThese show up in 20-35% of **Google coding interview questions**:\n\n1. **\\[23\\] Merge k Sorted Lists** (heap/merge)\n2. **\\[128\\] Longest Consecutive Sequence** (hashing)\n3. **\\[295\\] Find Median from Data Stream** (two heaps)\n4. **\\[380\\] Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)** (design)\n5. **\\[394\\] Decode String** (stack)\n6. **\\[269\\] Alien Dictionary** (topological sort)\n7. **\\[340\\] Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct** (sliding window)\n8. **\\[417\\] Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** (multi-source BFS/DFS)\n9. **\\[684\\] Redundant Connection** (union-find)\n10. **\\[494\\] Target Sum** (DP/subset sum)\n\n# Tier 3: The Differentiators (L5+ and final rounds - 10-20% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[4\\] Median of Two Sorted Arrays** (binary search on answer)\n2. **\\[10\\] Regular Expression Matching** (DP)\n3. **\\[218\\] The Skyline Problem** (sweep line/heap)\n4. **\\[224\\] Basic Calculator** (stack/parsing)\n5. **\\[282\\] Expression Add Operators** (backtracking)\n6. **\\[315\\] Count of Smaller Numbers After Self** (BIT/merge sort)\n7. **\\[332\\] Reconstruct Itinerary** (Eulerian path)\n8. **\\[460\\] LFU Cache** (design)\n9. **\\[685\\] Redundant Connection II** (union-find + directed)\n10. **\\[727\\] Minimum Window Subsequence** (DP/two-pass)\n\n# Tier 4: The Specialists (System design coding hybrids - 5-10% frequency)\n\n1. **\\[31\\] Next Permutation** (array manipulation)\n2. **\\[57\\] Insert Interval** (intervals)\n3. **\\[212\\] Word Search II** (Trie + DFS)\n4. **\\[240\\] Search a 2D Matrix II** (2-pointer grid)\n5. **\\[261\\] Graph Valid Tree** (union-find/BFS)\n6. **\\[271\\] Encode and Decode Strings** (design)\n7. **\\[310\\] Minimum Height Trees** (graph trimming)\n8. **\\[329\\] Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix** (DFS + memoization)\n9. **\\[336\\] Palindrome Pairs** (trie/hashing)\n10. **\\[354\\] Russian Doll Envelopes** (LIS variant)\n11. **\\[363\\] Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K** (prefix + TreeSet)\n12. **\\[378\\] Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix** (heap/binary search)\n13. **\\[399\\] Evaluate Division** (graph/union-find)\n14. **\\[406\\] Queue Reconstruction by Height** (greedy sorting)\n15. **\\[421\\] Maximum XOR of Two Numbers** (bit trie)\n16. **\\[425\\] Word Squares** (trie/backtracking)\n17. **\\[480\\] Sliding Window Median** (heaps/balanced BST)\n18. **\\[490\\] The Maze** (BFS/DFS variants)\n19. **\\[652\\] Find Duplicate Subtrees** (tree hashing)\n20. **\\[668\\] Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table** (binary search on answer)\n\n# Patterns We've Noticed\n\nAfter tracking hundreds of Google interview reports, clear patterns emerged:\n\n**Phone Screens (45 minutes):** 82% pull from Tiers 1-2. Expect one medium, possibly escalating to medium-hard. Islands (200) and LRU Cache (146) dominate here, they appeared in 47% and 45% of phone screens respectively\n\n**Onsite Round 1-2:** Mix of Tier 1-2 with occasional Tier 3. The focus stays on clean implementation. Sliding window problems (340, 239) spike here\n\n**Onsite Round 3-4:** Tier 3-4 problems emerge. This is where Skyline (218) or Expression operators (282) separate L4 from L5+ candidates\n\n**Time Management:** Our data shows successful candidates average 25 minutes for Tier 1-2 problems, 35 minutes for Tier 3-4. Nobody expects perfect solutions for the hardest ones, clean approach with solid complexity analysis matters more\n\n# What's Changed in 2025\n\nComparing 2024 to 2025 Google technical interview questions, three shifts stand out:\n\n1. **Graph problems surged 30%** Union-find specifically jumped from 8% to 14% frequency. Problems like Redundant Connection (684, 685) moved from rare to regular\n2. **Pure DP decreased** Classic DP like Edit Distance dropped 40% in frequency. Google now prefers DP hidden within other patterns (Word Break, Target Sum)\n3. **Design hybrids exploded** LRU/LFU Cache, Serialize trees, Encode/Decode strings, these coding+design problems now appear in 35% of interviews, up from 20% last year\n\n# How to Use This List Effectively\n\nBased on successful candidate patterns:\n\n**Week 1-2:** Master Tier 1. These ten problems aren't just frequent, they teach the core patterns for everything else. Do each one three times: brute force, optimized, then from memory\n\n**Week 3-4:** Complete Tier 2. Focus on pattern recognition. When you see \"k distinct elements,\" think sliding window. \"Find median of stream\" always means two heaps\n\n**Week 5-6:** Sample Tier 3-4 based on your target level. L3-L4? Touch them lightly. L5+? These differentiate you\n\n**Daily routine:** Our data shows successful candidates practiced 3-4 problems daily, spending 2 hours. Quality beats quantity, understanding why approaches work matters more than solution count\n\n# The Resource\n\nFor those interested, we maintain a live database at [LeetWho.com](http://LeetWho.com) where we track actual Google coding interview questions as they're reported. It shows which problems appear in which rounds, when they were last asked, and what approaches work best. Gets updated weekly with new interview reports. The patterns become really clear when you see the actual frequency data.\n\nThe database includes solution patterns, time complexities Google accepts, and common follow-ups for each problem. Seeing \"\\[200\\] Islands follow-up: count distinct islands\" appearing in 23% of cases helps you prepare for the actual interview flow.",

    "raw": "Meta Offer Interview timeline and experience\n\nPaying my r/leetcode tax, this sub helped me a lot with my prep so paying back to the community.\n\nAbout me:\n\n6.5 YOE, 0 in big tech.\n\n700+ leetcode problems solved in 1.5 years (on and off).\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nDay 0: Saw a post from Meta recruiter and reached out to them. They looked at my resume and asked to schedule a call to discuss about my experience.\n\nDay 5: Had a call with the recruiter, discussed my experience with developing backend systems and experience in system design for 2+ years. They said currently there is no hiring going on for IC4, I will be considered for IC5. It will be either hire for IC5 or no hire. They explained the full interview process. I asked for 2 weeks of time to prepare for phone screening.\n\n\n\nPreparation for phone screen:\n\nPurchased leetcode premium and solved Meta tagged questions from past 30 days (around 157 problems).\n\nHuge shoutout to Coding with minmer youtube channel. I saw him mentioned few times on leetcode discuss section and here, glad I found his channel. I watched the playlist (around 60 videos) twice and it helped me immensely for screening and full loop.\n\nSolved the questions by using a timer.\n\nDid 5 peer mocks with my friends.\n\n\n\nDay 20 Phone screening coding round:\n\nWas asked 3 questions including follow up.\n\n1. Valid Palindrome - ii: This question I was able to solve in less than 5 minutes and do the dry run may be in another 3 minutes.\n\n2. Valid Palindrome - iii: This was asked as a follow up, I was told that Meta does not ask DP questions, but I was prepared for it, so gave the optimal solution and coded up the recursive solution and explained that it can be optimized using memoization.\n\n3. Random pick with weights: This question I practiced from coding with minmer youtube channel, explained brute force and optimal solutions. Explained the trade-offs. Implmented and did the dry run for the optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI felt extremely lucky that I got the questions I have seen before. This was my first interview after 4 years, I have been preparing for more than a year. So, getting the known questions and able to solve them under pressure gave me a little hope for onsite rounds.\n\n\n\nDay 22 Follow up: Recruiter sent me a mail after exactly 48 hours after the interview to call them. They told me that I cleared the screening and invited for full loop interview. They will be connecting me with another recruiter who will be handling the full loop. Got an email introducing the new recruiter asked me to schedule a call to discuss the full loop.\n\n\n\nDay 26 New recruiter connect: Had a call with new recruiter, they were very friendly and explained me the entire process and what is expected in the each round of the interview. The call went for more than an hour. I asked for 3 weeks for preparation.\n\n\n\nPreparation for full loop:\n\nI was confident about the coding part, so concentrated more on system design for full loop. Recruiter told me that system design and behavioural will be given more importance for IC5 level. Below are the resources I used for preparation.\n\n\n\nSystem design:\n\nHave been watching some random vidoes for past year, but did not prepare with a plan. Have read Designing data intensive applications book once, know the concepts but did not give a system design interview earlier.\n\n1. Read Alex Xu system design interview books vol 1 & 2.\n\n2. Followed youtube channels like Hello Interview, Jordan has no life, System design interview and showoffer.\n\n3. Did 1 paid mock on Hello Interview. The decision was no-hire, but he gave me some actionable feedback, I still has one week to prepare. I worked on those weaknesses.\n\n\n\nBehavioural:\n\nWent through the meta core values and understood what they are looking for in a candidate. Discussed with my colleagues on what we did to refresh my memory. Noted down the stories and prepared them structurally according to STAR format by taking help from chatGPT.\n\n\n\nInterviews: As I have signed an NDA, I will not be giving the questions directly.\n\n\n\nDay 45 Full loop day 1:\n\nSystem design round: Was asked a variant of one of the questions on hello interview. I gave a solid design but could not discuss many trade-offs and do the deep dives. I used up a lot of time for scoping the question as I have not seen the variant before. Did not feel confident that I cleared the round. Did not have any other interviews that day. I felt that I was lacking enough practice. After the interview, all I was thinking was about the mistakes I made during the interview and why I did not think of few things. I knew the solution but could not present it properly. I was shattered and did not do anything for the rest of the day.\n\n\n\nDay 46 Full loop day 2:\n\nCoding round 1: Was asked 2 Leetcode medium question variants, that I have seen before. 1 is a string problem based on stack, but asked to not use additional memory. One is a sliding window question. This round felt easy, wrapped it up 5 minutes early. Solved both questions optimally, did couple of mistakes but corrected them during dry run. The interviewer was friendly and answered all my questions.\n\n\n\nBehavioural round: I thought I prepared well for this but did not expect them to ask 10+ questions, I thought a maximum of 6-7 questions and had my scenarios ready. Did not do any mocks on behavioural rounds, so I was not able to give the answers in the correct format, but answered the questions honestly in 2-3 minutes per question. Very few follow ups were asked. In the end I ran out of stories and told them, I already gave all my stories and told them I can give the same story to answer the question.\n\nWas asked most asked questions, did not expect few questions but I answered them from my experience. Felt this interview went okay.\n\n\n\nCoding round 2: Was asked 3 questions (1 follow up). The first question was a tricky one with gave the optimal solution quickly, they asked me a follow up. I was able to easily solve it. Coded both solutions and did dry run. The next question was something I have never seen, it is related to graph theory, I took some time to understand the question. Came up with a solution (not sure if it was optimal), coded it and did the dry run. He gave few test cases to check the code, I explained how they are handled in the code. He was not convinced, had to do dry on all the test cases. Was able to finish in just about time. This interviewer did not spend time on introductions, went directly to the coderpad. Spent 2 minutes to answer my questions.\n\n\n\nOverall I was satisfied with coding and behavioural rounds, but did not feel confident that I will receive an offer because my bad system design round.\n\n\n\nDay 47 Recruiter reach out: My heart was pounding while answering the call, expecting the bad news to hit. Surprised to hear that they were impressed with coding and behavioural rounds, but felt that I might have had an off day during system design interview and asked to do a follow up system design but for IC4 level. They gave the feedback I have received for system design, although my design was good they felt they have got mixed signals and interviewer recommended to have a follow up round. Recruiter asked me for dates for follow up round, I asked for couple of weeks for preparing.\n\n\n\nSystem design preparation:\n\nI felt that I had the basics down but lacked practice, so found few buddies on hello interview discord channel to do peer mocks. During the 2 weeks I was giving 2 mocks every day with peers. Used the hello interview guided practice tool, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding of the solutions.\n\nHuge shoutout to Hello Interview, Stephan and Evan for their great product. Definitely recommend their premium subscription.\n\nDid 3 paid mocks, 2 on Hello Interview and 1 on prepfully. The prepfully interviewer was very experienced and asked me a complex question, he gave me great feedback.\n\n\n\nI was feeling confident this time around as this was for IC4 level. I was still preparing for IC5 level system design interview.\n\n\n\nDay 61 Follow up system design: Was asked a variant of the question found on hello interivew, spent some time on clarifying the scope. Defined the requirements, API and gave a design. Explained trade-offs and did the deep dives. I had few more points to discuss but I ran out of time. I spent too much time on gathering the requirements. I should have focused on time management during my mocks. The interviewer stayed back for 10 extra minutes to answer all my questions.\n\nOverall felt confident about my performance.\n\n\n\nDay 71 Recruiter call: The recruiter called me and told that the HC has cleared me for IC4. They told me that currently the team match process is slow and explained the next steps. I told them about my location preferences.\n\n\n\nDay 72 Recruiter call: Was not expecting a call from my recruiter, they told me that a position opened up suddenly and the HM liked my resume and is willing to talk to me. I asked them to send the team details. The location was not what I preferred.\n\n\n\nIt is from an org that is infamous for it's WLB or lack of it. I was apprehensive about speaking with the HM, as we will be allowed to only speak with 3 and reject two. But I saw on this forum and on hello interview discord that many people have been waiting for more than 2-3 weeks for team match. I felt lucky to get this opportunity and did not care about the WLB. I scheduled a call with the HM for the next day.\n\n\n\nDay 73 HM call: The HM was very friendly, he was interested in few of the points I mentioned on my resume. I talked about those experiences and he was looking for someone who has experience in those areas. He explained me everything that the team works on, the team structure. I had a list of 10 questions, he answered most of them before me asking. I liked the manager and accepted the team match.\n\n\n\nDay 74 Initial offer: The recruiter called me next day with an initial offer, I thanked them for that. I checked [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) previously to understand the bands for IC4 in that location. That was a lowball offer. Recruiter told me that they will discuss with comp team and will comeback with updated offer.\n\n\n\nDay 77 updated offer: The recruiter called me with an updated offer, which is middle of the band. I did not have any competing offers, so did not have much leverage to negotiate. Should have still negotiated but I lack the skills for negotiation. I accepted the offer. They told me that they are working on the offer letter. I should receive it via email shortly.\n\n\n\nDay 78 accepted offer: I accepted the offer and signed it.\n\n\n\nThis was a very long process did not expect to clear the interview when I was first preparing. I was exhausted by being in the constant state of prep. I know it's a cliche but, If I can do it then I think most of the people reading this post can do it. Although I was extremely lucky during this process multiple times. Keep grinding, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I wish all the best for everyone.\n\nI will be happy to answer any question that do not violate the NDA.",

The codebases you're exposed to are giant and complex, as you can imagine. Also, everyone there is pretty damn good. It's kind of like getting into the NBA or something: tough to get in, and tough to stay there. The caliber of the average employee is much, much higher in FAANG than other places I've worked. On my team at google the girl who sat across from me was a Rhodes scholar. The dude on my left went to MIT. The dude on my right had a PhD in CS from Berkeley. So, if you don't have what it takes to clear the dumb leetcode interview, do you think you will have what it takes to impress your coworkers? Because in order to get anything accomplished it's important your team thinks highly of you. \n\nDefinitely most daily work isn't under the type of time and stress pressure that you get in the interview, but there's a slow, lingering pressure that never really relents.",

    "raw": "My (long) Google interview experience\n\nTalked to a recruiter (\\~August) and scheduled a screenning interview. after the screening got feedback that it went really well and we scheduled the onsite rounds (virtual), asked for \\~month to prepare.\n\nOnsite (started \\~October):\n\n1.

LLD question, to design a tree like data structure with methods to get random nodes/leafs. (Hire)\n\nI thought it went well but learned after that each hint given by the interviewer reduced my score drastically, I think he was too harsh as I implemented a good solution and he agreed.\n\n4. Googlyness - went well, the interviewer was the team lead from the team match phase below.\n\nAfter the onsite is where things got unclear.\n\nThe recruiter provided feedback and said results are mixed and probably it's a rejection without submitting to the comittee.  \nThen she said she consulted with someone and he thought that if there is a team match, the committee can hire.\n\nI talked with one team lead (from googlyness), we discussed system design concepts based on my previous projects and it went really well.\n\nThe recruiter confirmed and said the team lead was interested and sent to the committee.\n\n**The committee rejected my application.**\n\nThen the recruiter suggested another non formal interview with a tech lead from the same group I was interviewing for, we talked, it went well, and the request was re-submitted to the committee.\n\nTook quite some time but eventually (\\~ January) the recruiter said they are **willing to hire only with level 3**, but even then , the team I talked to had only level 4 vacancies and she said it's a low chance to actually get hired as level 3 (althogh I was accepted at that level).\n\nShe agreed to give me one/two additional rounds (at this point we are already \\~6 months after the first phone call).\n\nPrepared a bit and did two additional rounds (\\~March), first was not so great, the second one was excellent, again she said it's mixed, talked to a new team again and again the committee didn't approve.\n\nFinally I was told that I can submit applications to level 3 jobs but in reality no one will want me, indeed I tried and all requests were rejected.\n\nOverall the process took roughly 8 months.",

    "raw": "Just finished Meta’s EM full loop. Ask me anything\n\n=====Update=====\n\nWas informed today that I didn’t pass the last loop.\nThe reason was that my project retro didn’t have a lot of complicated problems, and the ones that I did present  were solved relatively easily.\n\nTBH, not sure what to say about this. The project I talked about was one of the biggest one I managed (including 4 teams I manage and 3 stakeholder teams I don’t manage, and it took 3 and a half months to complete)\nThe feedback the recruiter gave me was also not helpful since he actually said “you are exactly what Meta is looking for” so I feel a bit confused from the process.\n\nAnyway, not much I can do about it. Hope the best for everyone and Good Luck with your loops\n\n\n======Initial post======\n\nSo, I just finished Meta’s EM full loop (haven’t heard back yet) this is what I had:\n\n2.5 months ago a recruiter approached me through email saying he found my profile interesting and would like to know if I wanted to start the process, I’ve responded and we scheduled a first session to talk about the process.\n\nWhen the call arrived it was more of a formality talk than a filtering one, I introduced myself and he went on to talk about the process, he ended up with sending me a link to my career page with a scheduling task to my first two interviews.\n\nThe first two interviews were behavioral and system design (i have selected the product system design). To prepare for the system design I worked with helloInterview.com (they have a very good interactive learning program), to prepare for the behavioral I’ve built a stories board (using trello) elaborating all experiences divided by categories (failure, leadership, ownership, conflict..) also using AI chat (Claude ai) to get used to verbally tell these stories (getting used to STAR framework).\n\nWhen the interviews arrived I felt really prepared, both went very good, one thing to note is that the system design was different than anything I practiced (it focused only on the client side, touching a bit on api and no server side architecture at all) it took me a bit by surprise but I’ve managed to pull through, the behavioral was 4-5 questions about me as a manager and my experience.\n\n10 days after got the email that I passed and was moving to the full loop, they changed my recruiter to a different one which contacted me to update me on the full loop interview and what do to next. We finished the call with him sending me the resources and told me to get in touch when I feel prepared to schedule the 5 interviews.\n\nThe next loop was 5 interviews \n- Coding: was told it would be 1 easy 1 medium \n- People management: questions about how I manage my teams and cross functional management \n- Project retro: I was told it was a talk about a project I managed\n- Career / Management: questions about my experiences as a manager and the motivations that drives me\n- System design: I was told it would be the same lines as the previous one\n\nWhen the interviews arrived this is what I had\n- The behavioral interview were just like expected: 4-5 questions on what and how I managed myself as a manager, most common questions are: conflicts (was asked that in every interview), cross functional, mentoring. You should focus on STAR framework and most important how you monitored the situation (before, while, after)\n- Project retro: was not what I expected. It wasn’t a retro at all, it as very similar to the behavioral interview where I was asked 4-5 questions from on different projects and how I handled myself in them. If you have a major project that had a lot of things I would answer the first question with it and push the interviewer to ask the rest of the questions on that project, if you don’t, be ready with 3-4 projects with a lot of examples.\n- Coding: was asked 2 medium questions \n- System design: was 100% not what I was preparing for. I was more focused on the client / server side (like every example found online, and on the HelloInterview site) but the question was how to integrate a component inside of another bigger component that is hosting it, while working with another 3rd party service that I needed to plan it’s api. Don’t think I did that good there 😕, but on the other hand I would never think to prepare for this kind of questioning.\n\n\nIn summary, I hope that the rest of the interviews were good enough so it covers the last system design.\n\nAll the interviewers were amazing, very pleasant and helpful, I was not treated with inpatient in any part of the interviews. They were all extremely kind and professional.\n\nOne thing to remember, which helped me a lot. If you treat the interviews as a conversation, and communicate your thoughts, the interviewers will try to assist you.",

    "raw": "Had my Amazon SDE-I onsite loop today.\n\n**Round 1 – Behavioral:**  \nThe interview lasted around 30 minutes, and the questions were heavily focused on the “Dive Deep” leadership principle. I shared 5–6 solid examples but also subtly indicated in one of the stories that I don’t have extensive experience in that specific area. The interviewer was quite conversational, and we had a long chat afterward where he thoughtfully answered my questions. (Not sure if that makes a difference, but worth noting.)\n\n**Round 2 – Low-Level Design:**  \nInterestingly, the interviewer started with the same behavioral question as the previous round. I mentioned that I had just answered it and shared a similar story. For the LLD part, I blanked out for the first 2–3 minutes—probably nerves—but then I gathered myself and completed the design correctly. There was a moment where she thought I was taking a different approach, so I clarified what I did and then explained how I’d adapt it to align with her suggestion. She said we were in a “good place” with the solution.\n\n**Round 3 – LeetCode/DSA:**  \nStarted with Question 1: shared the brute-force solution, began working on the optimal one. The interviewer asked me about a specific variation in the approach. I didn’t have an answer immediately but eventually came up with one and explained it. It seemed right, and I implemented and dry-ran the solution successfully.  \nQuestion 2 followed the same pattern—brute-force, then optimal. I missed a step during the optimal dry run and spent 3 minutes debugging. Eventually, I asked if I could restart, and he agreed. I began the new solution and got halfway through the dry run, which was correct. Time was running out, so I asked if I should walk through the rest—he told me not to stress and to focus on getting a working solution. Only 2 minutes were left, and he had another meeting.

    "raw": "Awful experience at Amazon SDE 2 bar raiser round\n\nHey folks,\n\nI just had my Bar Raiser round for Amazon SDE-2 (I have about 3 years of experience), and honestly, I walked out feeling more confused than anything else. I really need some advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.\n\nThe interview began casually with introductions, but then the interviewer jumped straight to a one-line HLD question:\n\n“Design an authentication system for a user on the checkout page of Amazon by a 3rd party service.”\n\nNow, this was a very vague statement. I immediately asked clarifying questions like:\n\n\t•\tDo I need to authenticate card details, UPI/VPA that the user enters?\n\n\t•\tShould the system save these details after authentication so they can be reused in the future?\n\nThe interviewer said yes, but also pushed me to think “more from a customer perspective.” That threw me off, because the way the problem was worded, I was laser-focused on “authentication” (identity + card verification). I tried to brainstorm requirements, but I kept circling around the same authentication flow (validating card, validating UPI, storing secure tokens, etc.). He didn’t look satisfied, and even though I eventually proposed a design, I could tell it wasn’t what he was expecting.\n\nAt the end, I directly asked him what he wanted me to cover. His response honestly left me scratching my head. He said he expected functionalities like:\n\n\t•\tAdding/removing payment methods\n\n\t•\tRouting payments via different channels\n\n\t•\tSaving payment details\n\n\t•\tOTP verification\n\nAnd my first reaction was: wait, how does this tie into an “authentication system”? That sounds much more like designing a payment service architecture rather than strictly an authentication system. Before I could ask further questions, the interview wrapped up. He gave me some generic feedback on system design, but I walked out feeling like the problem statement didn’t match what he was looking for at all.\n\nSo here’s where I need advice:\n\n\t•\tHow do you deal with super vague problem statements where the interviewer seems to have their own hidden expectations?\n\n\t•\tShould I always assume a broader scope (like going from “authentication” → “entire payment subsystem”), or should I stick strictly to the wording and risk missing out?\n\n\t•\tIf you were asked this exact question, how would you have approached it?\n\nI honestly feel a bit frustrated, because it felt less like testing design skills and more like a guessing game. Any insights, frameworks, or mental models you folks use for such ambiguous HLD problems would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

    "raw": "After 200+ problems and some interviews, I’m still trying to figure out—what’s really the key to acing these interviews?\n\nI've been studying LeetCode and DSA for several months now. I've solved 200+ problems, landed a few interviews, and made decent progress from the time I started interviewing to now. But if I'm being honest—it's getting *really* frustrating at times.\n\nI’m not giving up. I know the grind is part of the journey. But I keep wondering: what’s the *real* key to succeeding in these interviews?\n\nIs it luck? Is it pure memorization? Like I just can't figure it out.\n\nBecause even after solving hundreds of problems and being able to recognize a lot of these patterns more easily now in these interviews, it’s not only just about knowing the patterns.\n\nTake a problem like **Permutation in String, Making A Large Island** or **Candy, etc.** — these aren't just plug-and-play from memory. (Please take these examples \\^ with a grain of salt, I'm just saying a lot of problems require a **UNIQUE** approach, these may not be some to you but they are to me), and unless you’ve internalized the *approach* (not just the code), it’s easy to freeze under pressure vs problems like Koko Eating Bananas or Last Stone Weight or things you can figure out within the interviews.\n\nThere have been interviews where, despite all the practice, I get hit with a problem that's completely new—but I *know* it’s related to patterns I’ve seen. And yet there’s *always* that one edge case I miss. That one detail that trips me up. And boom—rejection.\n\nHow do people keep all of these patterns, edge cases, and strategies straight in their minds? Is it just experience? Muscle memory? Something I’m not doing? Luck?\n\nI guess I’m just trying to understand what actually helps people level up from grinding problems to consistently *acing* interviews.\n\nAppreciate any insight from those who’ve gone through this or are going through the same.\n\nEDIT: I also just want to include that for a lot of people, a lot time goes by between solving say Problem 15 and problem 176 that you may have completely forgotten you even did that problem. Especially before interviews, do you just try to crank out as many as you already did, etc.? If someone could share I would be so thankful",

It’s nonsense\n\nI feel like it isn’t really about how many questions you do, but how much you understand them.\n\nThe last 2 weeks I did nothing but DFS. I finally wrapped my head around it, and now when a dfs question pops up, it’s now “how do I implement these requirements into the dfs algorithm” and it makes even hard questions seem easier.\n\nThere usually is a brute force approach and an optimized approach. If you fail the interview for not doing the DP approach then your interviewer is a POS.\n\nUnderstand the algorithms first. Identify “oh, I should use a min heap for this” and once you have that, things start to fall into place",

    "raw": "Got an offer from Big Tech, but at a lower level and salary than expected – accept or retry later?\n\nI’m currently a Staff Software Engineer (level 7 in my company’s ladder) at a solid but lesser-known US startup, where I’ve been for 4 years. Our backend spans distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, SQL + NoSQL, LLMs, and supports hundreds of thousands of users—so I’d say I have strong, practical technical experience.\n\nBefore that, I spent 6 years at a local company where the challenges were more domain-specific than CS-heavy.\n\nRecently, I applied to one of the Big Tech companies for a **level 4** role (in their ladder: 1–2 = junior, 3–4 = mid, 5–6 = senior, 7 = staff). I intentionally aimed lower than my current level, thinking it would be wise to stay humble since this company’s bar is higher.\n\nThe interviews went well—3 out of 4 were excellent. The only weaker one was the **software design** interview (I’d rate it \\~2.5/5). I wasn’t expecting the exact format, so I was a bit thrown off. I’d definitely prepare better for that next time.\n\nThey gave me an **offer for level 3** (one level lower than I applied for). The recruiter mentioned the software design interview multiple times and said it’s better to start lower so “expectations wouldn’t be too high,” otherwise I might “get into trouble.” Honestly, that comment rubbed me the wrong way—I feel like one interview result is being used to down-level me more than necessary.\n\n**Salary-wise:**\n\n* Base: \\~30% lower than my current salary.\n* With sign-on bonus in stock (1-year cliff): \\~15% higher than my current comp for the first year.\n\nI realize I might’ve made a mistake aiming for a mid-level role instead of senior, but the final offer still feels disappointing. At the same time, this is the only Big Tech office in my country, and it’s a rare opportunity to grow, learn, and boost my CV for future roles.\n\nIn comparison, few months ago I had an offer from a well known startup for Staff position with 25% higher salary than current (had to decline because of some unexpected personal matter at that exact moment).\n\nSo I’m torn:\n\n* **Option 1:** Accept, swallow my pride, get the Big Tech name, and work my way up.\n* **Option 2:** Politely decline, prepare better (especially for design), and reapply in 6–12 months for senior level.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

    "raw": "Please advise for Jane Street final round w/ no interview experience\n\nI'll preface this by saying I feel incredibly fortunate to be in this position, but I have a final round interview in person for Jane Street next week and am pretty terrified. I'm first gen/low income, so this is a life-changing opportunity not just for me but for my family as well and I feel obligated to throw everything I have at it. Essentially how I got here is that previously I've been fortunate enough to be part of a first generation college program at a FAANG company that provided an internship the past two summers, and I saw the trading salaries and figured I had to give it a shot. I've done some Leetcode on and off for the first time over the past month, and my first ever live coding interview was Jane Street's first round last week, which I luckily managed to pass. I saw online about the overall structure of the full-day interview with multiple rounds before/after lunch, and honestly just feel so scared that such a life-changing opportunity is so close yet I probably will end up blowing it since I have so much less interview experience/knowledge than all of the insanely talented people applying. So, I decided why not make a Reddit account and ask people who might actually know something because literally anything would help. Might be shouting into the void, but is the style similar to the first round interview or do they bring in more Leetcode-style questions or systems/other questions outside general coding implementation? Also, to adjust my own and familial expectations, about what percent of people make it through final round? Literally any other info also helps, happy to also answer questions if this does get any answers! Thanks so much!",

I'm first gen/low income, so this is a life-changing opportunity not just for me but for my family as well and I feel obligated to throw everything I have at it. Essentially how I got here is that previously I've been fortunate enough to be part of a first generation college program at a FAANG company that provided an internship the past two summers, and I saw the trading salaries and figured I had to give it a shot. I've done some Leetcode on and off for the first time over the past month, and my first ever live coding interview was Jane Street's first round last week, which I luckily managed to pass. I saw online about the overall structure of the full-day interview with multiple rounds before/after lunch, and honestly just feel so scared that such a life-changing opportunity is so close yet I probably will end up blowing it since I have so much less interview experience/knowledge than all of the insanely talented people applying. So, I decided why not make a Reddit account and ask people who might actually know something because literally anything would help. Might be shouting into the void, but is the style similar to the first round interview or do they bring in more Leetcode-style questions or systems/other questions outside general coding implementation? Also, to adjust my own and familial expectations, about what percent of people make it through final round? Literally any other info also helps, happy to also answer questions if this does get any answers! Thanks so much!",

        "body": "1. Good luck on your interview! You got this  \n2. Typically they cover these things (and some of them might be repeating in different rounds):  \n\\- Conversational (behavioral) round, where they will check if your personality matches company vibes (but it usually doesnt matter in Big Tech). A great practice would be some mock interviews with friends/random people. Also read 20-30 most common non-tech questions like \"Tell me about yourself\", and just memorize best answers for them.   \n\\- leetcode and algorithms. They usually do these round more than once, sometimes in person (on last steps, when they are almost ready to give you the offer). Its pretty simple with this one, you either grind leetcode (solve \\~100 mid problems, and you will be in a good shape), or use tools like [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoder  \n\\- system/tech designs. For you most likely will be 1 round (and 2 for senior positions). If you've built any personal projects - you should be all set with this one, since they dont ask for that much. Examples from my experience - design a url shortener, design autocomplete etc.  \n\\- Final round, on this one the company runs 1 more round of something they are not sure about you. Like algorithms, or system design, so, just be prepared for more than 1 round of any type of interview. \n\nOnce again, good luck! \n\n(Sources are from my personal experience, and experience of my co-workers)",
